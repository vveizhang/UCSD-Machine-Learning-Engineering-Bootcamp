JayIsADino,"&gt;It will place enormous pressure on governments to replace income taxes with sales taxes

I might be a bit behind on many concepts of cryptocurrencies, but I have to ask: why?  If people are paid in an alternative currency, the government will tax that as value, the same as if people were paid in gold. 

Edit: I‚Äôve decided to add some actual comments rather than just ask a question.

This is mostly based off bitcoin, because that is what I know most about and which has the best chance of competing with the USD currently.

I see transaction costs being a huge weight on bitcoins legs in the future. If it is to compete with the USD, it has to be really widespread. As more and more people use it, the transaction costs have gone up significantly. The only way I see them going back down is if more miners appear, which I think we‚Äôve neared the max, or if cost of mining goes down, which I don‚Äôt see happening fast enough to keep up with the demand.

I don‚Äôt think we would have to radically change economic thought either. Most concepts transfer over. Maybe the eventual lack of new currency would be different enough to create new economic situations, but I don‚Äôt think so.",dtjoia7,2,1/31/2018 17:59,,,,,,
rdar1999,"Last time I checked, roger ver didn't own bitcoin cash, so your entire criticism falls apart and I suspect this is why ppl dislike your video.

As for the rest, you need to experience using bitcoin cash, it is easy to look at charts, data, read posts, but how many actually *transact*? This is the biggest problem with bitcoin core for instance.

If you transact, costs a lot, doesn't confirm and experience is shit, I double dare you to continue to hold large bags. The person realizes it is absolutely unsustainable and it is pure hodl meme.

So many people come up with arguments like ""bitcoin is outdated"", ""increasing block is ridiculous"", etc. Well, if it works, it is cheap, reliable, why do you need complications? You gotta also check what's near to happen for BCH as opposed to BTC, there is a bunch of things BTC locked itself out by making the choices they've made. They simply can't scale properly. BCH has multiple teams with proper funding working on it.

To sum up, the only thing that can happen to BTC that cannot also happen for BCH is LN (for now, Tx malleability can be fixed for BCH too but no one is in a rush I suppose), but that's hardly an advantage. Conversely, there is a cornucopia of things that can be implemented in BCH and not BTC:

1 - limitless block size = never blocks will be full = always penny Tx going on;

2 - colored coins - aka tokens and simple smart contracts;

3 - privacy features;

4 - ""dumb phone"" transactions = transact without even having internet connections;

5 - Zconf transactions (0 confirmation safely);

Idk where we will be 12 months from now, maybe all fail, but for me it is an easy choice, with or without roger ver, or person xyz.",dtjoi61,2,1/31/2018 17:59,,,,,,

clifak,"Don't worry, I didn't forget about you, I just grew tired of responding to someone whose agenda is clearly to discredit crypto/blockchain through misinformation. That said, I'm bored right now so I figured I'd throw you a reply. 

&gt; And yet doubling Bitcoin's capacity to process transactions while consuming less power still has ethereum consumer way more power per transaction than Visa or straight up handing someone cash. A financial system that requires millions of GPUs in warehouses and warehouses is not efficient.

I used ETH because it's the next highest market cap coin. There are plenty of cryptocurrencies that are more efficient. As the technology is refined new coins come to market that employ improvements in scalability, transaction speed/amount, power consumption and various other features.

&gt; We don't use stocks as currency. Do I really have to expand upon why stocks and currency are different and should remain different?

How is that relevant to my comment? My point is that both can be treated as investments and both payout a percentage of what you hold. Obviously a stock is a share of a company while proof of stake/crypto is considered a currency, but both involve investment to support the greater machine.

&gt; Other cryptographic tools that have existed before the blockchain do this more effectively. Some of them, such as Merkle trees. There are even decentralized ones.

Oh you poor boy, you do realize that merkle trees are a component of blockchain right? Each block header contains a merkle root helping protect the integrity of transactions. Blockchain takes it further by containing additional info in each block that the merkle tree does not such as the timestamp, nonce, and hash of the previous block. It's okay, I don't expect you to know this since throughout our exchange you repeatedly show that you know just enough about crypto to put out bad information yet sort of appear like you know what you're talking about.

&gt; It's putting ideology over economics.

LOL! Here you go again, repeating something that doesn't pertain to the discussion. I'll bite anyway.

It's not putting ideology over economics or the decentralization of a person's financial info as you stated earlier, it's about an immutable, secure, transparent, simple, and fast ledger with shared control. Blockchain transcends crypto which is why you see large companies across all industries exploring and testing ways to implement it into their structures. It's worth noting that Jerome Powell from the FED is on record saying the FED is looking at blockchain to have significant applications in the wholesale payments part of the economy.

I'd also like to point out that Bitcoin was born out of ideology as were some other amazing technological advancements like the internet.  As a centrist you should know that, it was your people who pushed for the web.

&gt; This is why I don't like mining. It creates incentive for miners to control a bigger and bigger portion of the mining hashing power because it means more profit, and because it's decentralized, it also means they have more control over the currency itself. Bitcoin could do something about it's egregious fees, but there's incentive to keep things the way they are by the miners.

For someone who seems to be such a advocate of the free market and capitalism, I'm a bit surprised you're against the economics of the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin isn't perfect. There are a lot of factors that impact transaction fees so it's not as simple as saying Bitcoin could do something about it if they wanted, however, it will need to find a way to address its shortcomings to survive long term. If not, there are plenty of other cryptos that address Bitcoin's problems so it will adapt or be replaced.

&gt; Because banks add value added services as middle men, miners do not. Banks provide fraud protection (if a seller does not deliver a product, I can dispute the transaction with my bank. If I used crypto, I'm fucked because the blockchain is irreversible), frequent flier benefits, etc etc. Banks charge vendors a lot more than they charge consumers, because that's how they make their payment networks attractive to consumers.

Miners can't steal your money or gamble with it. Let's not pretend the massive subprime mortgage and risky derivatives trading catastrophe didn't happen. Let's also not forget who fucking paid for it. 

&gt; I don not want the entire global economy to have to rely on faith alone to prevent bad actors from bringing the whole system down. The problem is not only people attempting to profit from double spending. It could be hostile states attempting to cause financial damage for the sake of it. A lot of miners use software that automatically changes what they mine based on what is the most profitable. A government would easily have the resources to manipulate a chosen coin for long enough that people start mining different coins, then bring their mining rigs online, and cause all the mayhem on the blockchain that they want. If bitcoin ever stops being a plaything for libertarians and the actual means of exchange for economies, this would become a matter of national security, not merely an economic concern.

Who wants the global economy to run on crypto? I don't think anyone(certainly not me) is advocating for crypto to replace fiat. Crypto is still such a small market so don't be silly. You're not going to find any major government using a decentralized coin as a means of exchange. You might, however, find governments and banking systems using some of the underlying tech to facilitate exchange but if and when that happens one could certainly bet it will be a centralized currency.

Btw, just because libertarians were early to the scene and were vocal about their support for Bitcoin it doesn't mean they're the only people currently using it. I remember reading that Libertarians and Democrats were the two largest holders.

&gt; It's the way it's actually measured IRL and not in theory.

No, it's measured by what one is willing to exchange for it. You know, there was a time before governments printed fiat when many different things were used as currency. Some had intrinsic value while others did not but what all these things all had in common was their speculative value beyond their practical use.  

&gt; it still lacks any progress besides becoming a speculative bubble and a means for criminals to move money around.

Volatility does not equal bubble. While it's certainly possible that bitcoin is a bubble, I see a lot of people like you saying it's one without offering any support for that argument.  What we do know is that price is driven by a limited supply and high demand which is basic economics.

&gt; I don't lose my money if I forget my password or my hard drive fails. I am protected from malicious sellers/other forms of fraud, because my bank can reverse transactions. I can use paper money for even more privacy. My savings are FDIC insured. I don't have to wait an hour at the checkout for my transaction to go through. The value of my money does not fluctuate by double digits every day, so I don't have anxiety about when to spend and when to save based on that. I don't have to worry about child pornography being stored on the ethereum blockchain, literally unable to be erased from the internet and spread with every transaction.

Well, some of the things you mention are what happens when one chooses to be their own bank. It's possible to find yourself in similar situations if you're holding and dealing with cash. Also, I'm not sure if you know this but crimes are also committed with fiat. I know, I know, it doesn't fit the narrative you're trying to present.

&gt; Every ""problem"" crypto has solved is a solution looking for a problem.

I really got to hand it to you, your generalizations are packed with some next level bullshit. I also like how you often swap crypto and blockchain whenever it suits you.

&gt; This is why crypto is inferior to fiat. People don't have to be subjectively convinced that their currency is revolutionary in order to use fiat.

The technology.  I don't know how many times I need repeat it(clearly a lot) but the tech behind crypto extends beyond fiat's use. Shit man, the blockchain can be used with fiat if that's the sort of use case one is looking to implement. This discussion was never about crypto being better than fiat.",dtjoh2n,2,1/31/2018 17:58,,,,,,

thalos3D,"&gt; I'm not an economist, but the value of crypto currencies are still tied to the fiat dollar, are they not? It's not as if cypto currency is tied to anything tangible, as the US dollar used to be.

It used to be that a US dollar was exchangeable, on demand, for a certain amount of gold. That is no longer the case, and it's not the case for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is one medium of exchange. The US dollar is another. As both are freely tradeable, there is an exchange rate set by the market. Something to keep in mind with regard to Bitcoin's volatility is just how new it is. Gold has been around forever. I think with an established track record, Bitcoin's value will stabilize as well. Or maybe not Bitcoin. There are technical reasons why it might not be a good choice to be the next ""dollar.""

&gt; I think establishing a national currency was appropriate at the time, but now that any place in the US can interact with any other place in an instant, we do not need the state to create that sort of stability in our markets. Thoughts?

It's still early days. I'd personally want to see the technology get shaken out for another couple of decades before we make our economy even partially dependent on it. Once that happens, though, I imagine markets would become more stable, not less. Governments are driven by politics, and political considerations make for poor management of the currency.

jstolfi,"The energy consumed by mining does not depend on how many transactions there are, but on how much money the miners receive from solving blocks.  The difficulty of mining and the total hashpower will adjust until the total cost of the energy (the largest cost item for the big miners) is a large fraction of the miners' total revenue.

Currently miners receive 12.5 BTC (or BCH) for each block that they solve, and the difficulty gets adjusted so that ~144 BTC blocks (and ~144 BCH blocks) get solved each day.  At ~10'000 USD/BTC and ~1500 USD/BCH, that comes out to 18 million USD/day for BTC miners and 2.7 million for BCH miners.  (These numbers do not include the transaction fees, that are paid by the users and depend on how disputed the networks are.)  So one can guess that BTC miners are now buying maybe 10 million USD/day of electricity, while BCH miners are buying maybe 1 million. 

That cost is paid by new bitcoin investors, not by the users of the network (the people who use the network to make payments).  Still, it is instructive to divide that cost by the number of transactions processed in a day,   

+ The BTC network is saturated at 1 MB/block or ~300'000 tx/day at peak, which gives ~33 USD/tx

+ The BCH network is now processing about 1/10 of that, ~100 kB/block or ~30'000 tx/day, which gives ~90 USD/tx.  (It could of course process much more, up to 8 MB/block at present, which would mean ~2'400'000 tx/day and ~1.3 USD/tx, if the BCH price remained the same.)

The miners' revenue per block will drop by half a couple of years from now.  Apart from that, the only way that the total cost of mining could drop in the next few years is if the price of the coins dropped significantly.  If it wasn't for speculative trading (people buying bitcoin in the hope of profiting from rising price, rather than for use as currency in payments), it has been estimated that the price would be less than 100 USD/BTC. 

As for the cost of mining per transaction, it would be reduced if the number of transactions per day  increased significantly, without a change in the coin price.  ",dtjodmv,2,1/31/2018 17:57,,,,,,

&gt; Maybe I should clarify what I meant. There are many who believe that Bitcoin is the end-all-be-all of cryptocurrencies and that it is the only one with the highest credibility etc. I agree with your statement about code/network having to be proven, safe, etc. However, there are several coins that come to mind that will run circles around Bitcoin's network. For example, Ripple's network is in a totally different league than Bitcoin. Ripple's network runs as silky smooth as a Patek Phillipe, whereas Bitcoin is more akin to a Casio or Timex. The ultimate measure of success for a blockchain company/foundation and its respective cryptocurrency is through adoption. Like you've said, Bitcoin has been around for +10 years. However, where is this mass adoption by Bitcoin and its worldwide domination of fiat currency etc? Where is Bitcoin's adoption by the major retailer, companies, etc worldwide?  When you think about it the only mainstream adoption Bitcoin has is that of serving as the defacto base/exchange cryptocurrency at a majority of crypto exchanges solely due to the fact that it was the first to the market. Yes, Bitcoin has, what I like to call, sporadic ""boutique"" retail usage here and there, but nothing noteworthy after +10 years in the game. Let me put it this way. If Bitcoin's network is so magnificent then why don't we hear of its mainstream adoption? That is a simple question. Let me be clear, I'm not bashing Bitcoin. Like I've stated else where the blockchain technology that gave rise to Bitcoin is Nobel worthy. It's just a little sad to see so many people clinging onto this delusional fantasy of how Bitcoin is going to be this domineering Fiat killer with its ""Lightning"" fast network is going to solve Bitcoin's problems. The major underlying difference between Bitcoin and Ripple/ XRP goes back to what I spoke of before and that is ADOPTION!!! Ripple has actual adoption of its blockchain technologies (xCurrent, xVia, and yes, even xRapid) via +100 banks and FIs around the world. Think about this, when you can lay claim to have captured over 80% of a country's (Japan) entire banking/financial system for cross-border and domestic transactions via your blockchain network, you are moving in the right direction. Ripple's more recent collaborations announced last month also include: A Central Bank Infrastructure Initiative and the Credit Card Industry Consortium (in Japan) via their SBI partnership. NO OTHER blockchain company/foundation can lay claim to Ripple's level of adoption by corporations/industries and the global financial community as a whole‚Ä¶‚Ä? NONE!!! While every other blockchain can only speak of ""collaborations"" and ""proof-of-concepts."" Ripple can actually show evidence and provide proof of how they are solving their ""ACTUAL"" customers problems.",dtjoana,2,1/31/2018 17:55,,,,,,

biggest_decision,"&gt;as the internet has demonstrated, routing is absolutely possible up to billions of addresses.

Yes, at the expense of decentralization. The internet today is a massively centralized system, is this the future you want for cryptocurrencies?

&gt;some people might connect to dark net markets, others might only connect to coinbase.

You think you'll still be able to transact with darknet markets in a highly centralized LN? If the network is centralized, it will be incredibly easy for governments &amp; businesses to shut down communication with any undesirable LN nodes. Only a decentralized system is censorship resistant.

&gt;As no developer has ever suggested that the lightning network will serve all use cases, it's perhaps unsurprising that you can think of specific cases where a lightning network transaction will fail to serve a specific need.

Being able to successfully route transactions, using a mechanism that scales well, isn't a ""specific use case"" that LN fails to serve. A scalable, working routing mechanism is a fundamental requirement of LN. Without a routing solution that scales better than current Bitcoin, why bother using LN at all? I can't see where I mentioned a single ""specific use case"" of LN, these are all fundamental issues of LN that EVERY use case will deal with.

&gt;bitcoin nodes need to track both every address on the blockchain AND check and validate every transaction. The lightning network utterly removes the second requirement

Except it doesn't, because of the routing problem above. Every LN transaction is a channel update, current LN routing requires every channel update to be broadcast to every single LN node. Every single LN node will then need to verify the signatures of the transaction to update it's routing table.",dtjo662,2,1/31/2018 17:53,,,,,,

When technology is invented at a later date than existing technology doesn't necessarily mean it's innovation.

Although Lightning is cool. It shouldn't be the solution for scaling Bitcoin. It's a bad programming practice from a service oriented architecture point of view. It's a monolithic architecture. If you consider Bitcoin a ""payment service"". What do you do when the service gets overloaded? You scale out the service so that it can handle the increasing load. You normally don't build a 2nd service on top of the first one hoping that it will offload the underlying service. Also there's no reason why Lightning is the only possible solution.

SheepIt83,"I agree with you in the r/btc r/bitcoin debate, and do not like group thinking really.  Also r/btc is probably misnamed right now, they should switch names with r/bitcoin, would be more fitting. Anyway, it just developed this way.

I disliked your video although I understand your intention to be entertaining and getting attention from the masses.

Your video was called ""The TRUTH about Roger Ver"" before you renamed it. There are SO many lies going on about Roger on twitter and what not, and you chose to dig for anything you can take out of context against him.

In general, I think Roger is really unfairly treated because of group thinking of hating on him and also the plain lies and exagerations that are being told about him. Did you see some of the pictures? I am pretty sure he is not the devil himself and actually a decent human being (although I do not know him, just my impression).

To your points:

Roger doxing someone over $50 
This one.. hard to see this being taken out of context, sound ridicolous to me, he should not have done that. It probably comes from his libertarian attitude and his thinking that he needs to protect himself and not call the police or something. Anyways, it is also long time ago, hope he learned from that.

Roger making directly hypocritical statements regarding segwit / lightning. 
Most from what I have heared is that Roger is a fan of lightning in general, just thinks it can also be done on a main chain that scales.
I think it is very easy from the tons of statements he does everywhere to take something out of context and display it like he is insane or something. He also might exagerate and say something that he loves it just to get a point accross and so on. The quotes you cited, he probably was pointing out that we still need to also scale on chain and that the lightning network has problems... what is wrong about that? 

Side note to lightning network.. for me to show this as a use as a scaling solution, it has to be first implemented by most merchants and exchanges and so on (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew2MWVtNAt0&amp;t=5s this vid why that might be a problem i.e. ) 
And then it actually also needs to show that it can scale to billions of users were I see problems. ALSO the devs say that people should not use it right now, so no it is not ready and it will take probably years.

""Roger claiming to have sold &gt; 1000BTC for BCH then saying he hasn't""
pretty sure he was trying to get the point across, that he was not the one pumping the price from the start of bitcoin c ash to 0.5btc value as you can read so much about that on the internet. Every move bch makes.. oh roger buying bla bla.

Roger's correlation of calling bitcoin cash bcash like calling a minority a slur.
He kind of corrected himself  / explained how he meant it after jimmy song felt offended by that, seemed like jimmy was a bit calmed by that, you somehow left that out. 
ALSO you left out and displayed it like was the bcash thing that got him to freak out, while he was saying in his apologize (yes) video after it and several others that it was not him calling it bcash (still think it is rude after he explicitly said he felt offended by it) , but the fact that he repeated again another thing that goes around about roger, that he pays sock puppets.  You could see through the whole vid that he got more and more angry and still calmed himself down, told the guy thats not true and that offends him.. and he said that again. I would have quit him along time before that.

Other points: 
Roger Ver reading of a script with the mt gox thing:
He said he wrote it himself and wrote off of that and also he was shown money on the bank accounts of mt.gox, so he said that the reason there are delays in withdrawals, is not because of too little money in mt.gox.
He never mentioned they are solvent. And also they might have fooled him, think he had reason to beleive what he read there at that point.

I also think he is right about the media campaign against bitcoin cash, just try to see it in this light for a while.

It is probably just my personality to side with a guy that I think everybody bullies up against and hence I tend to see things in the most positive light, but try to not assume the worst.

bloodstainer,"Yes but you're coming from this with the mindset of ""Miners are bad, and everyone should work against them.""


that's an illogical statement, miners earn money, so does manufacturers and retailers. The only drawback to the two ladder, are when miners flood the markets with second hand graphics cards. Which is why AMD and Nvidia both play this safe this time around. 




Your proposed solution has already been tested via ASIC, and it turned out, it's a horrible solution, because ASIC age WORSE than gaming GPU, and have 0 re-sale value. 


If you **seriously** don't think miners earn money from reselling cards, you probably don't remember all the $65 HD 7970 and $59 7950 flooding the markets when bitcoin crashed last time, literally 40+ AMD 7970 only here on a single auction site in Sweden, where more than 5+ cards of the same model at the same time is extremely rare. 


AMD and Nvidia don't want to overproduce and have a lot of stock they can't sell. So they need to manage this safely. Miners though, why would they pay MORE to earn less? Your solution, doesn't work, because mining keeps getting harder with time, so long-term solutions isn't going to help anyone, and anything with an ROI higher than 8 months is a shitty deal! 


You're just spitting out empty words with no actual explanation behind them at this point. ""Supply will exceed demand, because they're buying way more cards than gamers normally would.""


Why would they do that? What point is there in buying those cards over gaming cards? Explain in logical terms, do they have higher hash-rates, are they cheaper, more power efficient? Explain how they're wanted by the miners, and why the manufacturers would bother designing them.


Make no mistake, as of this time, the only ones being screwed by miners **are consumers**, AMD and retailers are making big cash.

CryptoRocko,"HODL vs TRADING

HODL

This is the best strategies for 90% of the people. It is very difficult to trade especiailly if you are new to trading. So just HODL. If you believe in blockchain technology than just HODL, as the price should rise as more and more people appreciate the technology and see the benefits of it. I am a massive believer of blockchain techonology so I am HODLING!!


Trading
The strategy I am using to trade, during this crashes, is to sell when crashing and buy back at a cheaper price to own more bitcoin. Again this is risky. In the past I've lost money with bitcoin cash, TRON but made a lot of money when trading with XLM, XRP etc.

My suggestion is only trade if you have the following skills / experience:

    Day trading experience of other commodities (Technical analysis)
    Banking / Financial Industry Experience (Fundamental analysis)
    Understand Cryptocurrency and Blockchain
    Up to date with all Crypto News
    Controlling Emotions

Conclusion

I am a HODLER. I hold most of my portfolio. I have done day trading in the past so have good experience of technical analysis. I enjoy trading so do trade when I have time and see good opportunities in the market. However, I do not trade and risk more than 25% of my portfolio

I paid extra for ems shipping also and I got the same thing you did and really can't even find a review about Namfil 200. Hope they are modafinil . the tablet has no markings stamped on them and they are a 6 sided tablet. 
Has anybody else tried these, are they legit. I've never heard of the manufacturer before and their is very little info on the web about the manufacturer or Namfil 200. Next time I'll go to one of the better known moda pharma, I was using modup but there out of business. 
I don't use bitcoin, only because its such a pain in the ass to buy, and get a wallet,etc, so I use some type of credit gift card and some of the better sites don't except CC payments.
So if anyone has tried these or knows anything about them ,please educate me on this particular brand. Sorry I even bought them wanted modalert, or wanted to try wakelert to see which was better. I guess this is what happens when you try to save a few bucks, but in the end I really didn't save anything.... O well, live and learn, after all its just money....
Just a little update, took half (100 mg), and yes it's the real thing, actually like it better then modalert.

anatalist,"Just last year the rhetoric circled around ""immutability versus change"" and nowadays switched to ""innovation versus blocksize increase"" just because of Lightning. These have no place in the technical realm.

Since 2013, the blocksize limit should have increased with apparent increasing demand *in parallel with* off-chain applications, in order not to cut consumer adoption short. There are and have been many innovations that can be pursued in both domains. In my opinion, the reversal of consumer adoption has been very tragic for the crypto-currency movement as a whole, even though you will not appreciate it if you are after the fiat exchange rates.

Also, might I kindly ask you who made Roger Ver a role model in the Bitcoin Cash community? These suggestion don't strike me as too different from other attempts at misdirection, such as the claims that Mike Hearn wanted to be Bitcoin's dictator. Stain a character, stain a group. What makes Roger (and other incumbent ""enemies of Bitcoin"") distinct seems to be that he doesn't shut up that easily, a quality that had made him prominent in the Bitcoin space in the first place.

It is a fair opinion, the issue here is that Bitcoin (Core) is not trying to advance itself through tech innovation. It's doing the opposite actually, it's intentionally gutting the protocol of all usefulness in an attempt to lure all of the would-be Bitcoin users to a completely new network. Unfortunately, this tactic is failing and those users are largely ditching it in favor of existing solutions that already work. 

And I'm not some second layer hater here either, I think there's some great potential for layers on top of the protocol, after all Bitcoin is permissionless, anyone is free to build whatever they want on top of it.

Untrue. There is a difference. You are only seeing the effect of certain topics being popular in each forum, and you are assuming the cause is an echo chamber. 

r/bitcoin is an echo chamber because other topics get banned. 

r/btc is NOT an echo chamber. All bitcoin topics are permitted. But you see BCH topics being more POPULAR because it is a better product in the free market/open freedom forum. The key difference is freedom of choice.

Deliphin,"I know what the fuck fiat money is. If you actually read what I said, you wouldn't be trying to define it at me. I'll explain it again in simpler terms for you.

I said you were unable to defend the fact it's worthless with the point that it's fiat. Modern currencies like USD are proof fiat does not equal worthless. Fiat just means without a backing.

The fact it has no backing does not mean it is worthless. It only means that if the shared belief of worth goes away, the worth goes away. And there is a a shared belief that cryptocurrencies have value.

As for use, you're grasping at straws. An item does not need a clear use to be valuable. Some people will have something just to be able to say they have it, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. However, you can use them in a couple online stores. I won't deny, there aren't many places you can spend bitcoin, but they do exist. This [Article provides some examples](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-can-you-buy-with-bitcoins/).

Your specific examples are also poor. Cryptocurrencies are essentially ""internet money"". By that I mean, when you have a currency, 95% of the time, it's only accepted in that country. I can't go buy gas here in Canada with some Indian Rupees, I can't get groceries with Icelandic Kr√≥na, and I can't trade Pesos for anything useful here either. What I mean by this is, you don't spend internet money in real life, you spend it on the internet.

Lastly, I have never once claimed that cryptocurrencies are a good idea in any way, your points on it being useless, ""virtual pogs"", are pointless. I only claimed that it as a technology cannot be inherently a scam as you can claim. If you call a specific cryptocurrency a scam, given how many they are, I probably can't defend that, but calling the technology itself a scam is why I'm debating with you.

I am a firm domme - well experienced in virtually all D/s dynamics. I love playing with sissies and cucks but I thoroughly enjoy vanilla (non-fetish related) play as well. I love odd requests and encourage you to bring me fun/challenging requests (with an accompanying budget). I am 420 friendly and I **do** show face!

###My Snapchat handle is [xlaineylovex](https://snapchat.com/add/xlaineylovex)
###My kik handle is LaineyLactate

---------------------------

* **PM me on Reddit when you are looking for a Snapchat subscription or session**
* **Do NOT contact me on kik/snap unless you are ready to send payment**
* **If you contact me to arrange a session on kik please include: a description of the session you're looking for(text only, vid heavy etc as well as any fetish requests), a budget that matches the pricing listed below, your intended payment method (options below), and when you want to do the session. Messages outside of this format will be redirected to Reddit. PM me by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=laineyloves2lactate)** 
* **If you have any questions pertaining to Snapchat or sending payment read the entirety of my ad as well as my ToS on my subreddit (r/laineylove) and PM me on Reddit with your question or intended payment method.**

-------------------------

##Lainey's Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. Please note that I also offer kik sessions at the same rates as snap! As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions where you will have my full attention for the duration of your session. Unless otherwise negotiated I will start clothed and strip throughout the session, showing myself off, and interacting with whatever content you decide to send me. Once the session has started I will not pause or delay the session for any reason. While I'm open to suggestions and requests during your session, I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate our agreement without refund and may result in being banned on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on kik or Snapchat but it is my preference to use kik and it allows you to have the conversation for later use üòâ

##Cock and Cumshot Ratings

###Options for ratings include:

Rate|Price
:--|:-:

If you want me to use your name please allow for an additional $10 and I'll make sure to use it throughout the entire rating as if you were sitting right there before me, ready to play. Ratings are not intended to be interactive so please refrain from making any requests. I do not provide any pics/vids to help you get ready for your rate but I encourage you to check out r/LaineyLove to get yourself rock hard üòâ

This may include: nudes, teasing, public exposure, day to day check-ins, boy/girl content, early access to sales, updates on pre-made videos! I have been having a wild time and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day.

Maeler,"Roger Ver has alot of weight in the space in general. He honestly doesn't represent me due to his short temper and always coming off as a bit immature. But what really brought me to Bitcoin cash over Bitcoin is the simple fact that Bitcoin in one of it's earliest iterations was 32mb then it was capped at 1mb due to people spamming the network. Now back when it was 32mb Bitcoin were like what 10-50 bucks if that so tx fees were literally fractions of fractions of a penny. So capping the block size was seen as a good measure until adoption arose. If satoshi wanted larger blocks I believe that's the way we should go until second layer solutions can prove as secure and foolproof as the main layer. As of right now people are still losing Bitcoin on the mainnet lightning network (failing in my eyes especially with 4yrs of R&amp;D) no one has lost Bitcoin in the main layer* unless they were willfully careless. I.e. losing sole control of their private keys, sending to the wrong address, hard drive dieing and not having backed up their seed...


Edit: one more thing that turned me to Bitcoin cash is that fact that the lightning network effectively turns Bitcoin into a system of IOU's. Before fiat was introduced we were on a system of IOU's until they suddenly stopped allowing the silver certificates to be redeemed. I firmly believe in trading the underlying asset, because the second you stop touching the underlying asset it becomes that much easier for them to stop redeeming them for the underlying asset and before you know they'll start fractional reserve banking the btc.

Although extremely slow in comparison to CPU or GPU mining where m/billions of hashes take place every second, a single pen and paper hash takes around 15 minutes.


Therefore, I wish all of these goddamn miners could purchase an extra pair of hands or something and start computing by hand, until their hands fall off... and then they could purchase another pair, because it would be nice to be able to game decently again instead of having to pay about 70% of a build cost just for the gpu...

HackerBeeDrone,"Right now, bitcoin nodes need to track both every address on the blockchain AND check and validate every transaction. The lightning network utterly removes the second requirement and as the internet has demonstrated, routing is absolutely possible up to billions of addresses.

Further, unlike the internet, any payment network is likely to be massively more ""centralized"" because people aren't forced to join a local ISP network, instead they can simply connect with whatever other node they think gives them the most value. That will be different for different people -- some people might connect to dark net markets, others might only connect to coinbase.

As for censorship resistance, both the dark net nodes and exchange nodes would all have to collude to censor transactions. Yes, a specific route may be impossible (i.e. through coinbase to North Korea) so users can either choose to open a second channel with the route they want, or just transact on chain.

There's hulking great scads of innovation happening all around the cryptocurrency ecosystem, BCH with graphene and fungibility enhancements and on chain scaling throughput increases to keep it an optimal currency whilst maintaining the model proven through several years of experience, ETH with raiden and sharding, Nano and hashgraph with a completely new underlying distributed ledger technology not just iterating on the foundations of the past. 

And then over in the corner a fucking terrible cancer of a company financed by the traditional financial powers that be against whose interests any change in the global monetary status quo lies, and what are they doing? Spending *years* lying about technological underpinnings of the project, hiring astroturfing campaigns to push out their complete nonsense and confuse the legions of people who are being bought on board into a white hot space and simply don't know any better, and desperately trying to distract them from even grasping the underlying facts of the issue, censoring anything they can get their hands on which contradicts their idiotic narrative, and generally doing exactly what you'd expect a group employed to sabotage a world changing project like this would do.

I honestly think crypto has a lot more to worry about, the biggest being regulations. What happened in China will be the norm, not the exception. Old lawmakers don't udnerstand this technology yet, but once they do, they'll come down hard on the exchanges. Governments are just not in the interest of letting money move around, especially beyond borders, unchecked. So we will have to see if the pie grows at all. We need exchanges for the masses to grow the pie. Perhaps centralized products from banks/institutions is the way of the future.",dtjnfvb,2,1/31/2018 17:39,,,,,,

1. The website has no wallet.  A wallet is blockchain software capable of using the private key to sign a transaction and submit to the network. There is no chain yet. Furthermore, it is a *website*, and we all know IIS/Apache/nginx/whatever can be hacked.

chainxor,"""I am more in favor of Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash and am more in favor of technological innovation over block size increase.""

Fair opinion - sure. 
But the premise is wrong. You assume that the Bitcoin Cash developers do not innovate on things like block compression ie. do more than ""just increase blocksize"". Nothing can be further from the truth. There are several proposals being looked at to make eg. block propagation more efficient. For example, there is the Graphene block compression proposal that effectively makes block propagation 10x more efficient (combined with a few other methods, even more). That means that a 80 MB block can be propagated at the cost of a non-compressed 8 MB block (or better).

The definition of security is pretty clear. You can view it here.

Basically it means anything that gives you an ownership interest in an entity/profit-sharing interest/expectation of receiving interest etc. (for lawyers reading this, I realize that definition isn‚Äôt perfect, but I‚Äôm not trying to teach securities reg. on reddit).

Americans are barred from many ICO‚Äôs precisely because the sellers are pretty sure the ICO does fit the definition of a security, not because it‚Äôs unclear.

Merely owning a part of a bitcoin doesn‚Äôt give you an ownership interest in anything but that piece of bitcoin... no voting rights, no interest, no dividends etc. whereas other coins do promise those things, thus they are a security.

As for technological innovation for solving the scalability issue, the thing is that there simply is no scalability issue.

Giusis,"Why every transaction should be on LN?

LN ideally should be used for (relatively) small payments and when you need a immediate confirmation. Occasional (big) payments, money transfer, anything that could rely on the mining variance (where you don't need an immediate confirmation) and where the impact of the fees is not relevant, will continue to transact on-chain.

In example: if I'm gonna pay for a burger, I'm gonna use LN; if I'm gonna buy a new car, I will use the traditional Bitcoin transfer.

Actually this is not possible with the current technology, the only option you have is about a zero-confirmation transactions (BCH), that exposes the vendor and the network to other risks. The main issue is that the biased opinion toward accepting a zero confirmation transaction (the reason of why you still need multiple confirmations almost everywhere).

The LN isn't a network that is going to substitute the chain, it's a off-chain solution that will (should?) help the Bitcoin technology where it lacks (mostly, its slowness).",dtjn2on,2,1/31/2018 17:32,,,,,,

I'm open to any scaling solutions that keep bitcoin as useable cheap easy peer-to-peer cash and I'm not a maximalist of any coin.

I made a post around the time of your video saying that it would be great to see a discussion between you and Roger as I know both of you to be generally focused on trying to get at the truth, and as a fan of your poker videos, I've seen this ability in you shine in that arena. Some people agreed, but others balked, dismissing the idea due to what many perceived as non-philosophical arguments in your video.

However, I think that a conversation between you and Roger for all of us to see would help the whole crypto community get on the same page. We're not here to defeat each other but to defeat corrupt central banking and the death and destruction it leads to. As two people who are more dedicated to the truth than most, I think that a public conversation or a moderated debate would be of benefit to the whole community and advance our generally united aim.

Wezz,"I can give you my opinions on these points, but you definitely should get your own opinion, you can be told anything, you have to choose who to believe for yourself;

So bigger blocks being damaging to hardware/bandwidth usage; the idea would be to increase the blocksize as technology advances, a 1 mb block is already way out of date in terms of what most internet connections (or hard drives) can handle. There are talks of hard forking BCH to increase the limit to 32MB HOWEVER they are not planning on increasing the actual blocksize, just the limit - this means the blocksize is still 8MB, just if we want to go up to 32MB we can do it without a hard fork.

Roger Ver being a scammer I see as just character assassination, Blockstream needed to create a villain they could target and distract people with, and Roger was one of the first adopters who wouldn't sell out to Blockstream, so they chose him. There's not much else to it, he hasn't ever scammed anyone. 

You'll hear people calling him a criminal - he used to sell fireworks on eBay, which apparently makes him a hardcore felon. You'll hear people say he was in on the MT Gox crash, but he simply was trying to improve adoption and encourage people to buy Bitcoin - no one could really have known what MT Gox was going to end up as.

I personally can't really see any of what the Core trolls are saying, it's actually the thing that made me open my eyes to their censorship and projection, when I heard people calling him a scammer I tried to look for what he did to scam ""millions of dollars"" and I couldn't actually find anything... Only good things he has done for the Bitcoin cause.

SegWit didn't disable anything - it simply made the previous technology unable to utilize full potential. It's funny that Blockstream pushed so hard for SegWit to be implemented, saying it would cure all issues with full blocks, all our dreams would come true. Then when they were found out to be complete lies the Blockstream CEO [starts to advertise and promote a new miner that is amazingly SegWit compatible and has inside knowledge on how to get extra efficiency](https://news.bitcoin.com/the-curious-case-of-the-new-dragonmint-bitcoin-miner/) - this is all while Core trolls are complaining about Bitmain holding a monopoly... Like I said... Projection.

But these are just what I think of the whole sides thing. I honestly have no issues with Bitcoin Legacy and LN, but how Blockstream, r/bitcoin mods, and the Core troll army handle things just gives me life to fight against it.

suninabox,"&gt;This may change in the future if and when there is massive adoption of bitcoin i.e. hyperbitcoinization and price levels off and stabilizes at a high level.

I don't see how this is meant to happen without organic growth as a useful currency.

Less than .1% of the population has any significant holdings in bitcoin, and 80% of bitcoins have already been distributed.

if bitcoin is at $10,000 when .1% of people are competing for 16,800,000 bitcoins with spare investment money, how are the remaining 99.9% of the population supposed to buy in as their main currency without the price rising so high that their entire wealth is only worth a tiny fraction of a bitcoin.

It's a crazy level of hubris to think that a completely open source and replaceable currency is somehow going to entitle Joe Q Bitcoin holder who got 1,000 coins when they were cheap, to billions of dollars of wealth.

Exactly what value does Joe think he's creating that would be worth such a ridiculous premium when there are a limitless supply of alternative currencies?

It is not secure at all.  It may work, but there is no way to put a probability value on it.

Payment processors like BitPay have enough resources to monitor key points of the network and use some proprietary algorithms to increase their chances of detecting double-spend attempts at 0-conf transaction.  Yet they too cannot get an explicit probability of failure.  And using a payment processor is not really using bitcoin -- it is using a third party that both parties must trust.

biggest_decision,"Yes, it's not traveling salesman, we don't need to find the *perfect* route, just one that's good enough. Sadly, BGP isn't a good solution to this problem. The internet already faces big scaling issues with protocols like BGP. I don't think a routing protocol with scaling issues is a good solution for Bitcoin's scaling issues.

From Wikipedia:

&gt;One of the largest problems faced by BGP, and indeed the Internet infrastructure as a whole, is the growth of the Internet routing table. If the global routing table grows to the point where some **older, less capable, routers cannot cope with the memory requirements or the CPU load** of maintaining the table, these routers will cease to be effective gateways between the parts of the Internet they connect. In addition, and perhaps even more importantly, larger routing tables take longer to stabilize (see above) after a major connectivity change, leaving network service unreliable, or even unavailable, in the interim.

This problem has been partially remedied, by increasing the centralization of internet infrastructure. Major routes only exist between large organizations, ISP's, who in turn connect to each other through larger backbone networks. This does not seem to me like a good solution for LN, large centralized settlement hubs would make the network extremely vulnerable to censorship &amp; foul play.

&amp;nbsp;

The section I quoted also mentions the problem of instability, this is another big challenge for BGP. Changes in network topology (devices coming online/going offline, new connections becoming available of disappearing) require updates in BGP routing tables. The more changes in network topology, the more bandwidth &amp; CPU time used by these updates. A route must stabilize for packets to be successfully delivered along it, on the internet large routing changes can often take several minutes to stabilize when major changes happen.

This problem is made worse for LN, as it's not just network connectivity changes that will cause a change in the topology. Changes in channel states will also require a BGP routing table update. I have my doubts as to whether it will be possible to use BGP at all with LN once it grows, the frequent topology changes with channel updates may make BGP too unstable to route anything...

&amp;nbsp;

I think that this routing issue is really the most difficult one that the LN devs face. We don't have good decentralized solutions for it on the internet, and LN introduces so much additional complexity to the routing problem. Is a decentralized LN routing even possible? LN currently has taken the easy way out, and ignored routing scalability. Every node has an image of the full network topology.

So as it is, LN is no more scalable than Bitcoin, every node in the LN network currently sees every single channel update that happens (just like every Bitcoin node sees every on chain transaction). So LN is currently no more scalable than on-chain nodes with block pruning.

&amp;nbsp;

Or how about the problem of fraudulently rebroadcasting past transactions? According to the LN whitepaper:

&gt;For this payment channel, the contract terms are that both parties commit to broadcasting only the most recent transaction. Any broadcast of older transactions will cause a violation of the contract, and all funds are given to the other party as a penalty.

How are funds given to the other party as a penalty? By closing the channel with an on chain transaction of course! So if someone attempts to defraud you on LN (which you must either operate an always online node to detect, or pay some other service to remain always online &amp; monitor your channel), to get your money back you must pay on chain fees.

eqleriq,"&gt;  The more we use it, the more demand there will be. 

Bullshit. The more you spend, the more 3rd party intermediaries are hoarding bitcoin. The vendor you're using doesn't give a fuck about crypto, they're just seeing that some transactions (small, small minority) are cheaper than others. But they're getting fiat. 

The cost to entry for those vendors are people integrating the payment system onto their website or POS system. That's a cost that won't be recouped for a while even with ""cheaper fees.""


Anyone using bitcoin now is a fuckin dope, and they're goaded into believing they're ""helping valuation"" buy using 0.00000001% of the volume to buy a waifu pillow with giftcards paid for via bitpay or something. Zzz.


Crypto as an entity is not something that ""needs adoption."" It is something that will be harnessed by major commerce hubs as they see fit. And why would they not offer their own currency. 

We're back to the general store wild west where any entity can issue their own certificates. The difference is, they're all connected and valuated off of each other. You know, until they're not.

But are you trying to tell me that if Amazon or Paypal or eBay... or Apple, Google, Visa or whatever... starts their own crypto with some valuation relative to bitcoin that it won't all go tits up?

Have fun playing Wolf of Wall Street over this technology, but it's laughable to think that you're doing ANYTHING at this point by making a 3rd party vendor (or, you know, the guy on the corner selling xanny tabs for crypto) rich.



For the vast majority of the world their entry point into bitcoin is buying it from someone who bought in / mined at a pricepoint cheaper. 

Please give me your elevator pitch as to why they need to convert $ to BTC to buy things when they could ""just spend the $""? And do it without saying ""overthrowing the centralized banking system."" 


Because as soon as you get this adoption you're talking about that remotely resembles a threat to that system, you best believe the powers that be will drop a hammer on it's use sooooo fast that it would literally be no different than using fiat since you'd have to go through a, get this, centralized banking system to obtain/use it.



Until then, using bitcoin is a way to shave points off of a fool's money. Sure dude, by giving bitpay bitcoins at a nice vig you're really fighting ""the man.""

A sane approach to this is to ride it out until adoption naturally occurs because the technology can be leveraged. That's it. You're not part of that. A bot could ""use"" bitcoin.",dtjlsh1,2,1/31/2018 17:09,,,,,,
kal31dic,"What a pity you interpret it that way.  I don't know that people became rich through the successes I mention (possibly apart from the Sociomantic guys, but I'm not privvy to their personal financial developments).  Do you have any idea what the games industry pays for people at the top of their game compared to what they could earn elsewhere?  I don't think most programmers are getting rich just by working on a successful game.  Similarly, I don't think Amaury got rich through bitcoin cash - I'm not sure he made a penny and I'm sure he took a paycut vs working for Facebook.  So my focus really wasn't on money because that's by far not the most important thing in general or about this situation.

If you think that I'm making a statistical claim then you are mistaken.  The set of interesting and generative insights transcends those for which one can at this point easily gather statistical evidence in the time spent lying down with back pain whilst I wrote that answer (first draft on my phone). 

It's just eerie when a bunch of people you respect and think are very good but trapped in the wrong job for example two years later are in very much better situations.  In some cases a direct link with D and in some cases it's my doing by taking a chance on someone.  But it's somehow more than that.

I'm curious about which group you feel I looked down on in what I wrote, since I presume you are not just name calling 'business snob'.

Its not like we are short of programming languages these days.  If course it would be possible to be successful with Forth.  But language communities are not representative of the set of programmers at large - this point hasn't been controversial since ESR's essay on the Python Paradox.  So the kind of eccentric freakish weirdos like me that use a language like D - they assuredly didn‚Äôt learn it for the career opportunities.  And that leads to very interesting selection effects. 

You‚Äôre reading into what I wrote what isn't there.  C++ is dominant and will be for decades to come.  If we choose to use D, that's shouldn't be a threat to you or your skills.  Maybe we can learn from each other.  It's just the choice I made, and since people have the incorrect idea that D isn't used in business, I thought I would share my experience.

Programming languages grow slowly, and it's not a contest for number one.  There will never be a single C or C++ replacement because the world is different today.  So all D needs to do is to keep growing at a pretty respectable rate.  It doesn't need to steal market share from C++.

One of the most interesting projects commercially I have seen is software for building great big ships.  That's written in... Extended Pascal.  And they will either replace it with D or Ada.  The Pegged parser generator means it should be possible to translate if programmatically, but it's a lot of code and a lot of work.  ",dtjls0r,2,1/31/2018 17:09,,,,,,

Emrico1,"&gt; Firstly, IoT has a bunch of security issues. Most of those cheap Chinese gizmos aren't vetted by anyone for malware, privacy problems, etc.

Doesn't mean IoT isn't going to take off. Not in the slightest. It's going to be a multi trillion dollar industry. 

&gt; Secondly, this crash isn't remotely like the previous ones. A 10 to 20 percent decline passed off as a ""crash"" earlier, but the longer trend was still bullish. This time, there has already been a reduction of value to about 40% of what it was (20k to 9k), and the bears are still stronger. The longer trend has become downward, so the wise are just cashing out.

Wrong again. Bitcoin 'crashed' by ~40% [five times in the past](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/biggest-bitcoin-crashes-ranked/). Always after being up around 1000%. These are market corrections and dumping by new money. Bitcoin in January 2017 was $800. Today, $10,000. Don't believe the media. By pointing out an all time high as being a crash when the price literally doubled in a Month is absurd and ignorant. [The 'longer trend' is that bitcoin is growing rapidly](https://imgur.com/a/3rqOi).

&gt; Unlike a stock unit of GOOG, MSFT or AMZN, a crypto currency like bitcoin has no fundamental value

AMZN is a great example of a company that survived the .com crash... The best tech lives on as will bitcoin.
The intrinsic value of all of these companies is the service they provide. In the same way, global, instant, virtually free currency transfers are an extremely useful and valuable service. Not to mention the countless other use cases for crypto.

Those that didn't like the changes blockstream was putting out have rallied around BCH, and coincidentally already resided here in this sub. Anything that keeps it from being merchant adoptable was removed and IMO a more streamlined bitcoin has arisen. 

RBF does nothing if fees are low and everything is added in the next block, and only adds a risk of double spending. One could argue a lot of what was added doesn't make sense if fees stay low.

jwBTC,"&gt; We have a prophet over here

That's the fun of crypto, we really never know.  You have to be in this for a long time to see the patterns.

I started mining in 2011 with GPUs (Radeon 58xx cards) and always said I could mine a bitcoin for $3 and sell it for $6!  (/hindsight right?!)

I had a buddy who refused to upgrade to ASICs saying only the manufacturers will make money.  And Bitmain/Avalon/BFL proved that statement mostly true.  My first Avalon I paid 100BTC and it only mined 50BTC back, but those that bought BFL were scammed all the way so I guess I chose the lesser of two evils.  

Anyway, I've always said 80% drop is always possible, but it will be ""slow""  slide kind of like after MtGox when we went from $1200 down to $250 in a timeframe of year(s) not days or weeks.  So $1k we'll never see again but $3-4K is possible perhaps.

I was caught offguard by all these Alts, so I'm back to GPU mining because I have cheap power and hey it was fun last time, might as well have fun again!  

Bitcoin will only be 21 mlllion coins ever.  I don't think you guys get how rare crypto will become over time for the major coins that are respectable.  The only thing prices can do long term is go up when you keep adding new people to the market but it will definitely be a bumpy ride! ",dtjlj06,2,1/31/2018 17:05,,,,,,
t_hab,"Blockchain is an extremely useful technology for keeping a secure record. Right now, with most coins, the blockchain technology is effectively used to keep track of itself (e.g. bitcoin blockchain keeps track of bitcoin transactions), without any underlying asset, but the real magic of blockchain technology is that it can be used to keep track of anything digital. 

This has the potential to change land registries (especially for poor people), reduce the costs of trading on certain financial markets, and maintaining licenses/permissions across all sorts of fields. 

There is plenty of reason for people to see blockchain technology as a groundbreaking revolution without believing in the current generation of cryptocurrencies. ",dtjliz8,2,1/31/2018 17:05,,,,,,
gotamd,"&gt; One could point out, as blocks were getting bigger, miners were getting more centralized.
&gt; 
&gt; However there are too many parameters that can affect this, so I believe this logic is not sufficient. The main thing to realize: there is literally no better empirical evidence to support or debunk the connection, than this, so your argument is: ""I didn't see any evidence the Yeti doesn't exists, so it must exist."" This is a common fallacy.
&gt; 
&gt; However, what we have is a straightforward theory.

I think you have your analogy reversed.  I have taken the position that we have no evidence which causes us to reject the null hypothesis.  When evaluating the impact of something on a system, the null hypothesis is what must be overcome.  The null hypothesis is, essentially, the default assertion that whatever it is we're testing has no impact on the outcome of the system.  My point is that I have not seen sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis with regard to the impact of realistic block sizes (ie, not 100+MB, at least right now) on miner centralization.

&gt; It is. No matter how you count it, you'll get about 2 to 4 times higher miner centralization on BCH. For example if you count all the Bitmain proxies, you'll get about 40% dominance on Bitcoin and 80% dominance on BCH. This is dramatic.

jstolfi,"&gt; It isn't guaranteed but there is another way through network effect. If enough merchants accept bitcoin (cash) they could conspire to dump if miners broke 0 conf to hurt long term profit margins for miners to encourage them to be honest with handling first come first server transactions.

That would be like bombing a city to the ground because someone in there stole a car. 

One technical problem with that idea is that it is  impossible to prove that a miner broke some 0-conf rule, because it is impossible to prove that he received the ""good"" version of a transaction before he got the ""bad"" one and put it into his candidate block. 

The lesson of 25 years of failed attempts to solve the ""trustless payment"" problem is that the ""network effect"" of a comunity of ""well-meaning"" players can't solve it.

nullc,"I think what I'm talking about is related to but distinct from that-- basically viewing engineers as low status button pushers.  Even though it's not unusual for top tier engineers to perform work of tremendous impact and importance and be paid as well as or better than many top tier professionals in other well paid fields (e.g. doctors and lawyers).

I don't get the impression that this was as much the case in the US in the 1950s  but it is today.

You can see this with the Bitcoin unlimited folks with statements like the developers of bitcoin have no business doing anything but deciding where they put semicolons in the code base (actual claim)... instead they think nearly totally non-technical  parties could some how do the job of designing bitcoin by merely enumerating wish lists.

I've wondered if some of this might arise out of resource fights between industry and academia.  Really good technical talent is highly prized in both domains. To some extent resources are fought over by insulting the other side-- with academics sometimes portraying industry as uncreative and unimportant button pushing, and industry looking at academia as a bunch of wankers solving irrelevant toy problems and congratulating each other on how smart they are.  To bystanders-- who correctly observe that the aptitudes for top performance in either domain are pretty similar-- it sounds like they both groups disagree on the details but agree that technical experts are losers. :)",dtjl7h3,2,1/31/2018 16:59,,,,,,

I still vividly remember the exact same posts in the Antshares subreddit. People were having very high expectations and though they were very smart because they invested in something which was going to explode at the end of the month... Wrong, the price went from 8$ to 5$ and it stayed around this price during more than a month without anything happening. You know the rest of the story.

Regarding Icon, in reality, things are just going exactly as expected : Icon will take months until showing its potential. There are still lot of things to build. Tons of things which will grow. It will take time, it is not going to happen tomorrow, sorry for this reality check.

So you may wonder why investing in Icon at all ? Because Icon is here to stay in the long term. Contrary to a lot of other blockchains we're seeing today, Icon is building something valuable and profitable in the long term. I think your money is safe in this project. It may dip now, it will come back. I have absolutely no doubt about that. I don't have such certainty regarding old generation blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ripple or Litecoin.

420yolocaust,"&gt;Being able to capture more of the market because your product(s) can do more things is one of the primary indicators of market cap.

Says who? Bitcoin is maybe the most limited technology, yet I see it at #1. Ripple is only trying to service international bank transfers, extremely niche, yet its #3 in market cap.

Explain to me how the robust-ness of the technology is correlated with market cap, because evidence points to the contrary.

&gt;When someone says ""X has more offerings than Y"", you can make a baseline assumption that the market cap potential for X is larger, because there is more market to capitalize on.
In short, whichever coin promises the most should expect the highest valuation? Do you invest in normal stocks as well, because this is horrible logic. With this in mind, Tron is winner.

jstolfi,"&gt; 99.9% reliable is enough for many use cases

There is no way to give an explicit bound to the probability of a 0-conf transaction being confirmed.  Satoshi could claim that bitcoin was a solution to the problem only because he could prove bounds for the probability of reversal -- after at least 1 confirmation.

If there is a way to dupe a vending machine into releasing a coke for free, even if only in 5% of the attempts, all bad kids in town will try, if only for the thrill when they succeed.

Proponents of 0-conf often say that the solution should be limited to transactions that are small enough for the risk of fraud to be acceptable.  But no merchant will accept being defrauded of $1 (and not having anyone to complain to).

By the way, 99.9% is similar to or better than the reliability of 1-conf transactions.  Again, if one could fin a way to give that reliability to 0-conf transactions, then one could forgo the blockchain and mining, and just use that system.

The lowest threshold for payment if you mine to external wallet address is 0.01 BTC. Imagine that hack did not happen and you had 0.005 BTC mined. You would still have to mine 0.005 BTC to reach 0.01 BTC and then you would get paid.

As the hack did happen and you lost your 0.005 BTC, NiceHash is commited to reimburse that 0.005 BTC (this is called old balance now). But this does not bring you to the 0.01 BTC threshold for payment. You still have to mine 0.005 BTC to reach 0.01 BTC. Again, you don't have to mine to 0.01 for every reimbursed part you get, this is only for the total amount.

Now, we understand that 0.01 BTC is still high threshold for many of the external wallet miners. If Bitcoin TX fees will allow, we will lower this threshold to 0.001 BTC so many of you will get paid out faster!",dtjku2u,2,1/31/2018 16:53,,,,,,

The stimulus package was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on January 29, 2008, and in a slightly different version by the U.S. Senate on February 7, 2008. The Senate version was then approved in the House the same day.

Who cares?: Only people obsessed with Roger, to make an ad hominem attack on BCH. It is pathetic and annoying because Roger DID NOT MAKE BCH.  That is the fact you need to put in your video instead of jumping on the #fakenews mantra of Russia Russia Russia scapegoat.

That is why many BCH supporters do not care about what Roger said or did. It is irrelevant to the development of BCH or its qualities. And his arguments about BCH are actually true: it is faster, cheaper, and has less problems. Thus rational people care about the truth, not who is telling it.

How about do a video on all the shady things Theymos did? He actually affects the development of BTC, he has a criminal motive, he was caught running prior scams, and he censors the truth. So how about you report real news instead of fake news.

lubokkanev,"Something like that. Only one ""confirmation"" is possible every 10 minutes (that's an average). Every confirmation (block) gives more assurance that all the payments (transactions) so far are legit. For big payments, most exchanges wait for about 6 confirmations to be totally sure it passed through, so that's about an hour. For small payments, merchants do what's called ""0-conf"", which is instant, but a bit less secure.  So you could theoretically do 150 million transactions today, with that same 1% energy consumption. 

The chart is not wrong, but they are dividing the power on the number of transactions. It's like putting two peas in a bucket and saying each pea has half the volume of the bucket. You can put 100 more peas and by this formula, their volume will decrease, but together, they will always take 1 bucket, no matter the number. Same way, adding more transactions in the blocks will decrease the average energy consumption per tx, but the block is the same and it's energy consumption.

There's a lot of work to be done in terms of on-boarding payment providers and improving their wallet.

IMO the IOTA is ""exuberantly"" priced since the project is still in its infancy, however it's much less speculative given that governments and large companies are placing a stake in it.

DDR4 prices are shooting sky-high, as they're being fabricated for smartphones and tablets too. Unfortunately, this doesn't look likely to stop any time soon - so it might be best to just bite the bullet on this one.

Ryzen CPU's are fantastic, and well priced - so there's good news on that front. They also come equipped with 40 PCIe lanes, meaning you wont have any bottlenecking when it comes to Multi-GPU setups.",dtjjys4,2,1/31/2018 16:38,,,,,,

The reason people lose money is because they want to get rich quick. They often buy shitcoins  that are worth nothing in hope they turn into the next bitcoin. They have weak hands and zero trading/investing experience with no strategy and do minimal research. They buy on hype at all time highs and panic sell as soon as the market dips.  It‚Äôs a highly volatile and manipulated market, losses are made just as quick as gains are made.

It‚Äôs just like people investing in penny stocks/ 1c stocks on the share market. You get what you pay for, If you buy shit company‚Äôs you get shit. It‚Äôs high risk investment.

&gt; Businesses will never allow high value contracts to run on centralized tokens like NEO and Stellar that haven't been proven in the wild for years or that have unverifiable resistance to attack because of complexity like Stellar and Ethereum.

LaineyLoves2Lactate,"I'm Lainey Love (found at r/laineylove) and I am an open minded 23-year-old curvy MILF with over two years of online selling experience. I am a firm domme - well experienced in virtually all D/s dynamics. I love playing with sissies and cucks but I thoroughly enjoy vanilla (non-fetish related) play as well. I love odd requests and encourage you to bring me fun/challenging requests (with an accompanying budget). I am 420 friendly and I **do** show face!

###My Snapchat handle is [xlaineylovex](https://snapchat.com/add/xlaineylovex)
###My kik handle is LaineyLactate

---------------------------

* **PM me on Reddit when you are looking for a Snapchat subscription or session**
* **Do NOT contact me on kik/snap unless you are ready to send payment**
* **If you contact me to arrange a session on kik please include: a description of the session you're looking for(text only, vid heavy etc as well as any fetish requests), a budget that matches the pricing listed below, your intended payment method (options below), and when you want to do the session. Messages outside of this format will be redirected to Reddit. PM me by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=laineyloves2lactate)** 
* **If you have any questions pertaining to Snapchat or sending payment read the entirety of my ad as well as my ToS on my subreddit (r/laineylove) and PM me on Reddit with your question or intended payment method.**

-------------------------

##Lainey's Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. Please note that I also offer kik sessions at the same rates as snap! As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions where you will have my full attention for the duration of your session. Unless otherwise negotiated I will start clothed and strip throughout the session, showing myself off, and interacting with whatever content you decide to send me. Once the session has started I will not pause or delay the session for any reason. While I'm open to suggestions and requests during your session, I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate our agreement without refund and may result in being banned on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on kik or Snapchat but it is my preference to use kik and it allows you to have the conversation for later use üòâ

-------------------------

##Cock and Cumshot Ratings

###Options for ratings include:

Rate|Price
:--|:-:
Text|$15
Video|$25
Nude Video|$35

My ratings are provided in clips through kik recorded just for you. All video ratings vary in length depending on how much I have to say but will include a 1-10 rating as well as a detailed review about its appearance, what I would do with it, and my overall satisfaction. If you want me to use your name please allow for an additional $10 and I'll make sure to use it throughout the entire rating as if you were sitting right there before me, ready to play. Ratings are not intended to be interactive so please refrain from making any requests. I do not provide any pics/vids to help you get ready for your rate but I encourage you to check out r/LaineyLove to get yourself rock hard üòâ


Rate Addon [AVAILABLE FOR NUDE RATINGS ONLY]|Additional Cost
:--|:-:
Name use|$10
The Worship Rating|$10
Extra JOI and showing off|$20

##Premium Snapchat Subscription

Snapchat subscriptions give access to my private story which will contain nudes (picture and video) as well as a variety of other real life and SFW updates. This may include: nudes, teasing, public exposure, day to day check-ins, boy/girl content, early access to sales, updates on pre-made videos! I have been having a wild time and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day. For premium subscribers and only at my discretion I will open any content sent to me although I reserve the right to respond. I prefer to receive pictures of you smoking, chilling with your pets, doing something exciting, and **NOT** NSFW content. This does NOT include any guaranteed interaction and buyers should not purchase a snapchat subscription with the expectation of having daily chat.

Subscription|Price
:--|:-:
1 Month|$30
3 Months|$60
12 Months|$90

 &gt;""Bitcoin Crash!? Again?

&gt;by√Ç¬†Martin D. Weiss, PhD√Ç¬†and√Ç¬†Juan M. Villaverde

&gt;Dear Investor,

&gt;Thank you again for subscribing to√Ç¬†Weiss Crypto Alert!

&gt;For regular updates, be sure to check your inbox every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

&gt;That's when you can expect news from us about our√Ç¬†Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratingsand what's happening in the crypto market.

&gt;Your timing for getting our√Ç¬†
alerts couldn't be better.

&gt;Last week, we caused global outrage with our√Ç¬†C+√Ç¬†rating for Bitcoin. We were cursed, ridiculed and laughed at. One group even tried to mount a cyberattack against our Weiss Ratings website.

&gt;But yesterday, the price of Bitcoin plunged from $10,908 to $9,723. Nearly 11% in just 13 hours.

&gt;If that happened in the U.S. stock market, it would be a 2,846-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrials.

&gt;On the Dow chart of the last two months, it would look like this:

&gt;You'd see the shock and awe in this morning's news headlines:

&gt;""LOOK OUT BELOW!"" ...

&gt;""WORSE THAN 1929!"" or ...

&gt;""WALL STREET DUMPS ON TRUMP!""

&gt;But in the crypto world, even with 10% crashes, most folks barely bat an eyelash.

&gt;Crashes of 10% or more in a single day are not uncommon. They happen pretty frequently, actually. So do ten-percent surges. Also common: 10x gains like Bitcoin investors saw in 2017.

&gt;That's why most bitcoin lovers are√Ç¬†
long-term buy-and-hodlers.

&gt;No, that's no a typo. It's crypto-slang for the old-timers in the market since the early 2010s, many of which became millionaires and billionaires simply by sticking with it through thick and thin.

&gt;What about last year's horrible Christmas Crash that saw Bitcoin plunge from an intraday peak of about $20,000 to less than $10,000 in two weeks flat?

&gt;""Bah! We don't care,"" say Bitcoin veterans. ""And if Bitcoin made you millions or billions of dollars like it did for us, you wouldn't care either. We've seen the same thing happen before, or worse. After the last big crash, Bitcoin surged more than 20-fold. We love Bitcoin. That's why we're hodlers and always will be.""

&gt;So you can imagine their outrage last Wednesday, when we announced the first-ever crypto ratings and had the audacity to peg Bitcoin at a lowly√Ç¬†C+√Ç¬†(""fair"").

&gt;For more background on how we rate cryptocurrencies, read√Ç¬†this article.

&gt;If you are a subscriber to our Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings, be sure to log in and check the latest. They can change frequently.

&gt;If you're not a subscriber, you can learn more about our service√Ç¬†here.

ChoosyBeggor,"&gt;I didn't say that you said those things. :-) 

You actually did. The way you did is done implicitly. You quoted a part of my comment, and made a response. But the response you made does not line up with what you quoted. Therefore, we can derive what you implied by working backwards to the nonexistant comment you referenced.

For example, imagine I quoted your comment and wrote ""zebras are not reptiles, they're mammals."" Unless you are mentally deranged and handicapped and have some propensity to interject random unrelated trivia into comment chains, then by working backwards from my comment, we can derive the original supposed comment which will be something along the lines of zebras being reptiles.

But regardless, this is taking us off on a bad tangent that I wish you didn't start, but to answer your question (which should have been your original reply, not the poor presumptuous reply you did make), bitcoin, beyond being a decentralized crpyto, is the first of its type to reach mainstream awareness. The draw of bitcoin to the masses is less its technology, infrastructure, etc, and more its spectacle. The people are interested in the Bitcoin rollercoaster, they are nowhere near as interested in using the technology to make purchases or anything.

So I think the next spectacle will overtake bitcoin, and that spectacle could be Ethereum when it overtakes Bitcoin in market cap.

And my overall point is that Bitcoin, like most other first movers in technology will probably rapidly lose its market share to newcomers. The proof is pretty much in the pudding. Compare Bitcoin's market share in the crypto universe 3 years ago to what it is now with Ethereum on the fast track to overtaking it. This trend will continue, not reverse, in my opinion. Bitcoin will continue to have a smaller and smaller share of the market as competition rises. Especially once coins start getting professionally marketed. These coins' value is driven primarily by speculation, not any inherent and exclusive value, so the battle over market share is basically a battle over hype. Which ever coin gets more hype through marketing gets more share.",dtjjl8l,2,1/31/2018 16:31,,,,,,

dontcensormebro2,"* I am more in favor of Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash and am more in favor of technological innovation over block size increase.

I take issue with this statement.  Are you really implying that blocksize increases require no technological innovation?  Sure going from a 1 to a 2 or an 8 is one thing, but there are much bigger plans than this.  I don't know if you were paying attention, but there has been research into this identifying bottlenecks in the software.  Parallel mempool acceptance and identifying how to make asynchronous which was previously synchronous is not innovation?  Graphene, etc.  So confusing

It's like designing an engine.  An engine is to provide power and efficiency.  That doesn't mean you maximize efficiency at all costs.  Both sides have a cost.

I'll be honest, your ad hominems against Roger are disappointing. Why are you so focused on him?  None of the beef you have with him has even one shred of anything to do with Bitcoin Cash as a useful currency.  It screams rbitcoin propaganda machine.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: The transaction fees are actually 7$ in average right now (I have seen someone talked about a few cents in a Reddit post thus my mistake). And it went as high as 55$ one month ago.

In your buy / spend / rebuy scenario:

you have spent $10 of fiat, 

are holding $10 bitcoin, 

used $10 of bitcoin,

spent $10 of fiat,

and are holding $10 of bitcoin.


In my buy use scenario 

you spent $20 of fiat,

are holding $20 of bitcoin, 

used $10 of bitcoin, and are holding $10 of bitcoin.


You actually save on fees if you buy more at once, rather than purchasing twice.

In both cases you've used the same amount of fiat, and end up with the same amount of purchasing, and end up with the same amount of BTC holding... the only difference is you didn't use whatever 3rd party centralized buyer/exchanger 2x, instead only 1x.



I specifically stated buy as much as you can afford. That includes portfolio balancing. If you're inevitably going to use bitcoin and be holding the same amount, in every instance in history except dec/january it would have been profitable to buy more, earlier.

This is because you hang out here and you are indoctrinated to believe that there is some group of ""thoughtless butters"" who couldn't possibly just be making a reasonable assessment of what they think is happening and adopt the best long term strategy to deal with the uncertainty and volatility.

My strategy, because I accumulated so low, is to HODL most of what I bought and to sell at a very slow rate over time. In the past 2 years I've sold about 3% which was much more than my initial investment. I basically have a lifetime supply of Bitcoin so all of my new income goes into other types of assets, currently mostly real estate.

It's the most reasonable thing I can come up with, given the circumstances, especially considering if I tried to dump the top, I would have to pay a huge tax bill all at once.

CensorshipMustGo,"I think both you and /u/Rafek_Krajzan need to actually read the article you are linking.

My point is that past performance is no guarantee of future results. I point to the tulip craze as one example of an asset bubble where the values crashed and they never again rose to the highs they had achieved.

From the article:

&gt;That‚Äôs not to say that everything about the story is wrong; **merchants really did engage in a frantic tulip trade, and they paid incredibly high prices for some bulbs. And when a number of buyers announced they couldn‚Äôt pay the high price previously agreed upon, the market did fall apart and cause a small crisis‚Äîbut only because it undermined social expectations.**

If you still want to ignore the historical precedent of the price of rare tulip bulbs never attaining the heights they had reached during the tulip bubble, look at the scores of other examples from history.

One such example... the dotcom bubble of the late 90's. At that time, many dotcom stocks like pets.com were valued way beyond what their earnings would support. People kept pumping money into dotcom stocks because ""this time it's different!""

When it all crashed and burned, stocks like pets.com never came close to rising to the values they once commanded. True, there were some companies like Amazon that emerged and represented real value, but the vast majority of dotcom stocks were totally speculative and just because they had reached a certain price in the past was NO GUARANTEE that they would ever again reach that price point.

I am merely pointing out the fallacy in the belief that bitcoin (or ANY asset for that matter) will reach a certain nominal value based on prior performance. Look again at the post I responded to. The poster was saying bitcoin will go back up in value because it was once a higher value. There is no basis for this conclusion except faith and an erroneous belief that past performance guarantees future results.",dtjj8tx,2,1/31/2018 16:26,,,,,,

eqleriq,"first of all, my anecdote includes that spurring of vendor adoption, so your point is ... pointless.


secondly, snore, why bother? bitcoin failed as a currency, lightning + segwit will save it and people will adopt whenever it makes sense to.

reading people getting clubbed over the head trading digi currency in person and subway accepting it whatever, is such a short term mindset.

If bitcoin works AT ALL, you're a fool to spend even a minor amount of bitcoin as the valuation is going to make anyone even casually investing up to this point a major multiple of their money.

These things have been discussed since 2009, where you can extrapolate the ceiling value of 1btc as essentially 1/21,000,000 of all money in the world. What fraction of that do you think is realistic in 10 years?


All you are accomplishing by spending bitcoin is allowing shit like bitpay to accumulate massive amounts and act as a centralizing force in the longterm.

My own tinfoil tea-leaf reading: Vendors will never, ever be the ones ""accepting bitcoin."" It will 100% be some sort of debit/bank conversion directly. They set up their same network they always pay into and you slide some officially issued card, beep bop boop, bitcoin happened behind the scenes. They get either bitcoin or fiat, they don't care, because it's just lines on a spreadsheet that their bank looks at and converts on the fly.

misko91,"&gt;the great turkish war was the first time they ever lost territory in their history. 

What an interesting choice of words. It certainly wasn't their first defeat, as perhaps *Timur* and the existence of the old Ottoman Cores might help indicate.

&gt;If empires collapsed from losing a single war they would never sign a peace treaty.

Did I say collapse? I certainly did not. Ottomans did not collapse during this time period. But they certainly stagnated relative to their European rivals, and that's about as close as EU4 comes to showing decline.

&gt;Its not a stock chart, were not talking about bitcoin.

Yes and no. Yes, I agree with the substance of your comment. However, to the extent that it is ever useful to describe empires as ""rising"" and ""declining"", Ottoman decline must surely start sooner than when it is already called ""The sick man of Europe"" (which happens in 1853).

SnatchSnacker,"This is the section the alludes to their method:

And the chart below says:

&gt; Net inflow calculated as the change total supply of cryptocurrency units each year multiplied by the average price

I think it's saying that they can estimate the amount of new money being introduced by comparing the change in price with the increase in total number of coins. It kind of makes sense to me but I would have to diagram it out to really see it. They may have other methods as well.

JobDestroyer,"&gt; Well number 1 you can choose not to send it from Coinbase

So? If they see a 100 dollar bitcoin acquisition on Coinbase, then see all of it going to one account, then it's pretty obvious that the account is his main address. You could do it in 12 different transactions, or send bits of it to different addresses, but that increases the price of withdrawal by quite a staggering degree. 

The cheapest way to increase the privacy of your bitcoin involves going to shapeshift or something, selling all your bitcoin for monero, then selling all that monero for bitcoin again, depositing it into a new bitcoin address when doing so. This isn't fool-proof, mind you, and opens you to extra risk (price fluctuations, for instance). 

&gt;Number 2 despite them being able to see the transaction they have no ability to stop the transaction or freeze your assets. 

That's not a large enough selling point on it's own. Most (all?) cryptocurrencies have this as a feature. Besides, if they know *who* you are, then they can just perform some quick rubber-hose crypto-analysis to get at your bitcoin. ",dtjispk,2,1/31/2018 16:18,,,,,,

It's arguable whether it has any fundamentals at all but let's say it does - the fundamentals don't seem to be strongly correlated to the price so hard to analyse. So I'd be guessing if I named a price.

I *guess* hodling is a strategy but I wonder how much thought the average hodler puts into it? Even hodlers should take profits when available. No doubt the smart ones do but you hear too much ""hodl to the end"" to think that everyone is doing so.

Having a large pool of hodlers reduces liquidity so makes market manipulation less expensive. I'm sure it works well for  *someone*, not necessarily the ones doing the hodling. 

On the other hand, I'll comfortably predict that my share portfolio will grow in value at least 7% pa over the next 10 years. Boring and conservative numbers but reliable.

The past 10 years have been way better than that, more like 12% pa net growth but who's crazy enough to think that a past trend is a good guide to future value?

**Author**:  _DougPolkPoker_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;Hey guys, had a couple things I wanted to say, as well as ask this community. I'm hoping this can be a good discussion and I don't want to it to turn into mudslinging.

&gt;For starters, I misspoke on segwit. You need a malleability fix for LN, but it doesn't have to necessarily be segwit. (Although segwit was the leading solution). My mistake on this error.

&gt;I made the following statements in my video 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&gt;I am more in favor of Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash and am more in favor of technological innovation over block size increase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&gt;Even Bitcoin Cash sceptics will agree there are advantages of block size increase as a solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;Is this not a fair opinion? Certainly bitcoin is trying to advance itself through tech innovation, the question is which is better. Interested in what you guys think. 

&gt;After that, I more or less did not discuss Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash at all. The point of the video was not to attack Bitcoin Cash, but rather the decisions of Roger Ver.

&gt;I also said that

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I dislike  [r/btc](/r/btc)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also dislike  [r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe  [r/btc](/r/btc)  is incorrectly named.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;Both  [r/btc](/r/btc)  and  [r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  suffer entirely too much from group think, and then  [r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin)  suffers from heavy moderation. I think because of that, both of these subreddit suffer from being echo chambers that make them worse than subreddit like  [r/cryptocurrency](/r/cryptocurrency) . I would also like your thoughts on this.

&gt;As for Roger, my video was comprised primarily of ridiculous things Roger has said or done, and then also humor inserted in places I found it funny (it is certainly debatable if it was or not). But I want to focus on the factual parts.

&gt;Probably the most disturbing thing to me from many members of the bitcoin cash community, was the inability for people to distinguish the difference between a role model in their community acting inappropriately, to the validity of Bitcoin Cash as a currency. A leader of a group, while fighting for those peoples causes, does not get blanket immunity from their actions.

&gt;I did not see any bitcoin cash supporters bring up

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger doxing someone over $50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger making directly hypocrital statements regarding segwit/lightning &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger claiming to have sold &gt;1000 BTC for BCH then saying he hasn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger's correlation of calling bitcoin cash bcash like calling a minority a slur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;I don't own bitcoin cash. It is faster than bitcoin right now. Block size scaling has upside. I might joke around about bitcoin cash from time to time but I have nothing against the currency. So my last question is, why do people not address these problems? Do the ends justify the means?What are your take on these issues?

Kain_niaK,"Only when bridges between BCH and fiat exist it can and will be regulated. Once there is an economy big enough that prices are now mentioned directly in to BCH then regulating it becomes exactly the same as regulating the internet. How do you regulate the internet without restricting its freedom? How do your regulate the international internet without regulating all the other countries? 

Well there is your answer. The more this new BCH economy grows the more the powers will try to regulate the internet. This means it will have less freedom.

Therefore we have a lot of work to do. Eventually we need to build local little digital islands. Things like community  build wireless mesh networks. Even when they are disconnected from the main internet, they only need to sync up once every 10 minutes .... with the exceptions for miners who need to always be connected. 

Anyway I am talking 10 - 20 years in the future.  But people with vision see this coming. Look at the USA! It's cracking down hard on internet freedom. Yeah the elite don't like this internet any more. 

BCH can only be regulated when you allow it to be regulated. So don't speculate but participate. Spend and replace is the way to move forward.

Those that just invest and then forget about it .... will miss out on the what Bitcoin is really about. Satoshi did not invent Bitcoin just to fix the problem of not having enough poor or rich people. Satoshi his software idea can destabilize the entire global economy.  But even if Satoshi would have shut up. Fiat and capitalism has peaked and they are on their way down. So this destabilization will happen no matter what,  but nobody knows when. Satoshi just build a backup system so at least there will be a plan B. 

So my friend, arm yourself with knowledge and get an understanding in to plan B. Because if you do not prepare you might loose a lot of your financial power. (and if you never had any, here is your chance to get in to the game!) And the banks might come for your house one day. They will want either 100 000 000 USD in hyperinflation or a little bit of stable Bitcoin.  Get that house payed of and get out of debt. The old system was build upon debt. The new system will be build upon math and computer programs. It's scary!  But do not be in distress. You can be armed with knowledge and there is still plenty of time to prepare.

jstolfi,"Layer 1 requires a limit to force all bitcoin users to switch to layer 2.

Layer 2 will not work unless it is a closed bitcoin economy, such that each user spends through the LN all the coins that she receives through the LN, and vice-versa.  

If ""only"" 50% of the bitcoin users switched to the LN, while the rest persisted on using directly the bitcoin network (BN), and bitcoiners paid bitcoiners without distinction of which system they use, then 25% of all payments would be LN-LN, 25% would be BN-BN, and 50% would be  LN-BN or BN-LN.  The later would require closing and re-opening at least one channel which is two on-chain transactions.  Then, every 100 payments would require 125 on-chain transactions -- which is worse than if there was no LN and everybody just used the BN.

And bitcoiners *must* be forced to use Layer 2, because they are stupid and will not recognize the brilliance of Greg's design if they have the option of using Satoshi's.  You cannot let people seek freedom on their own; you must *force* them to choose the right path.

nopara73,"&gt; Pruned nodes do validate the entire transaction history. They just remove irrelevant data at the point where it becomes irrelevant. When they are initially syncing, they will download and verify all historic data. The amount of pruned data is configurable beyond the basic UTXO set.

Note that pruned nodes cannot serve full nodes.

&gt; Has SegWit increased miner centralization on Bitcoin? I have never, ever seen real evidence that larger block sizes and corresponding increases in block transmission times have had any impact on miner centralization.

One could point out, as blocks were getting bigger, miners were getting more centralized.  
However there are too many parameters that can affect this, so I believe this logic is not sufficient. The main thing to realize: there is literally no better empirical evidence to support or debunk the connection, than this, so your argument is: ""I didn't see any evidence the Yeti doesn't exists, so it must exist."" This is a common fallacy.  
However, what we have is a straightforward theory.

&gt; You can (and, in fact, already do) have a fee market without full blocks. It would also be much more predictable and robust than a fee market with full blocks.  

I tend to agree with you on this point. In theory miners would mine smaller blocks to bump up fees to some levels to keep them alive. Yet, I'm not 100% convinced.  

&gt; Bitcoin is not that far off where miner centralization is concerned. I would think that if blocksize/weight were a major factor with regard to miner centralization, that Bitcoin Cash would be dramatically more centralized, but it is not.  

It is. No matter how you count it, you'll get about 2 to 4 times higher miner centralization on BCH. For example if you count all the Bitmain proxies, you'll get about 40% dominance on Bitcoin and 80% dominance on BCH. This is dramatic.  
Now, there are social factors to consider here, for example Bitmain created BCH to still be able to use covert ASICBOOST, so no surprise here. However BCH blocks are empty, so this line of your argument is not only incorrect, but also irrelevant.  

From another point of view, the BCH has only a couple of people running fullnodes. It, of course also cannot be argued for smaller blocks, because it turned out this way due to social issues. We know this, because, again: BCH blocks are empty.  
BCH: https://twitter.com/SondreB/status/943690490523856897  
BTC: https://twitter.com/SondreB/status/943690490523856897  

The difference is staggering.  

A couple of other points:  

We are arguing as scaling would mean 100MB, while it is extremely small, 1.6GB may be enough for a large metro area (https://i.imgur.com/aI7HuXW.png).  

**PRIVACY.** Ironically the conversation never gets this far, but a huge problem with big blocks is private transaction retrieval. The main problem is: if you ask somebody: ""hey what are the balances of these Bitcoin addresses?"" well, you've just exposed to a third party what Bitcoin addresses you have, how much money you have, etc...

honestbuck,"Jamba, 
I'm an owner/operator of a 52 year old Multi-Million dollar USA based business.  I can do the math (and lot more) just fine.  Before we go any further on the potentials for KEY, I'm guessing you aren't clear on BTC's potential, maybe its because you're convinced that CoinMarketCap and the exchanges are have the final word on all this technology. Day and swing Traders tend not to get emotional attached to the companies they are trying to rape a living off of.
  
What do you think bitcoin would be worth if it successfully replaces 1/10 of the worlds broad and narrow money supply.  BTC is most certainly a hybrid between the two.  Give it another 5-10 years for real use cases because right now its value is chump change that traders play with. 

Answer: If all 21 mill total Bitcoin replaced just 10% of the worlds money supply (at todays numbers) it would have a face value of $12 trillion USD. That's $571,000.00 per coin. Dude!   Let me know where I went wrong.   This is why the IMF, and many others are starting to get EXTEREMLY nervous and finally paying attention.    

Back to KEY: Knowing what I know about the worlds market for Identify and KYC, plenty of room for massive growth over the coming years. And for all the ""good"" ""useful"" coins that will serve a real purpose and survive the coming storms, they will easily hit the $1,000.00 mark in the next several or more years. 

Here's is little knowledge on the current market and how SWIFT alone does KYC: ""7,000 correspondent banks that use Swift have about 1.3 million correspondent relationships, and are conducting 1.3 million document exchanges, often on an annual basis. Swift created their KYC Registry with the involvement of a working group of 12 leading correspondent banks, who agreed on a standard set of KYC information to address the needs of regulators in different markets. The KYC Registry will enable each bank to contribute their information for review and qualification by Swift. Once this information is qualified, it will be published in the Registry.
‚ÄúBanks can then share it with their counterparties with the click of a button,‚Ä?‚ÄúBanks retain full control over their information and who has access to it. The creation of a single, secure source of KYC information will enable big banks to collect information from their counterparties more efficiently, reducing cost and risk.‚Ä?
So, Look out world! 
I Think Key is on to something HUUUUUGE!  Maybe bigger than BTC itself.  Just HODL and don't look back.  Give it 10 years of growth just like it took BTC to grow and you'll be VERY pleased. If you want your 10x chump money on your 1000 investment go ahead and do your thing.

988pii,"Awesome question.  Those first 30 seconds are critical.  And not only is the tech irrelevant at this point, but you couldn't even begin to get people to understand even one tiny technical detail in just 30 seconds if you had to.

My first 30 seconds tries to address one of the biggest confusions most people have.  Most people have never had any need to think about the differences between barter, gold coins, currency that can be traded in for gold,  and fiat currency which is based on nothing except common agreement.

**Bob:**  Hey 988pii,  nice Lambo.  Where'd you get it?

**Me:**  Thanks,  I was able to buy bitcoin at $50 each.

**Bob:**  Oh, that's the magic money that drug dealers,  pedophiles,  and now apparently - you - are using.  I don't get it.  Where does it come from?  Is it just like, magic?  Why...  what...  I don't really get it.

**Me:**  Well,  thousands of years ago, people used to use teeth as currency - they were impossible to copy,  nobody had any real *use* for teeth,  but since you couldn't copy them, people could pay each other to do work or get firewood or whatever.  As long as everyone agreed that they could be traded, then they were valuable - it worked for thousands of years.  It's called ""fiat currency"" - the teeth have no real value, it's just a social agreement.  Bitcoin is the same except with Math instead of teeth.  These special numbers are impossible to generate - *you can't create new ones* - just like teeth - and as long as EVERYONE agrees that these numbers can be traded for real things like pizza and Lamborghinis,  then they have value.

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I think it's more important to make them understand that people can't just go in their office and print up some new Bitcoin whenever they want than it is to make sure your answer is 100% textbook accurate.

stu-safc,"Yeh this is interesting. I've done some research and I personally think the faster the better.. 

M = Market cap
P is nominal price level of goods
Q is output of ecosystem
V is velocity.

http://www.econmentor.com/college-macro/associated-macroeconomic-topics/money/equation-of-exchange-mv=pq--quantity-theory-of-money/text/362.html#Equation of Exchange (MV=PQ) / Quantity Theory of Money

V is the velocity of transactions per a given time frame (usually in a year).

So we want market cap to be as high as possible and therefore need a low velocity. Velocity is determined by the amount of money that actually changes hands for goods. Not the theoretical transaction time. In this way bitcoin probably has a higher velocity than RaiBlocks right now. 

Also I think the future likely velocity of Rai is likely to be small too. In the US you are encourage to spend your USD by inflation. Every day it is worth less so you should spend it ASAPto maximize its value. Given all this and the fact that you can transfer USD basically instantly (VISA 100k tps? Transaction time = 10secs?) and you would probably be surpirsed to hear the velocity for the USD is 4.4.

https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2014/september/what-does-money-velocity-tell-us-about-low-inflation-in-the-us

XRB being fast means it will be used for payments. Its a brilliant payment rail. This will increase adoption and make Q high. 
XRB will have no effect on P. 
XRB has no inflation so hodling is a valid investment and V will be low. 

Therefore the market cap will increase.

TLDR: Buy Raiblocks.

gnuworldorder,"Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value established as money, often by government regulation. It has an assigned value only because the government uses its power to enforce the value of a fiat currency or because the exchanging parties agree to its value.[1] It was introduced as an alternative to commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity). Representative money is similar to fiat money, but it represents a claim on a commodity (which can be redeemed to a greater or lesser extent).[2][3][note 1]

CleverNameAndNumbers,"With Bitcoin its deflationary because as demand for bitcoins grow but supply dwindles the value of a Bitcoin rises as people are willing to pay more for it. If you think of Bitcoin as a product than as a currency then it's exactly like inflation. Even if it's not doubling in value regularly and it's deflating linearly it's deflationary none the less. 

As for about bans, you can trade tokens anonymously all you want but the power of the government really comes in when businesses come into play. Businesses buy physical products and sell them to physical people and other physical businesses. You can't digitize a crate of bananas and transport it over the internet. Businesses also have to pay taxes which must be done in the legal tender of the country.

The closest it currently is right now is treating cryptocurrency gains as capital gains but obviously Uncle Sam wants his full due and the government won't be satisfied with businesses reducing their owings by using lower taxed financial instruments as currency. Especially if you can offset your actual gains with clever trading which would amount to tax fraud if done with USD. 

The big point is that despite crypto being pseudo anonymous the end users have identies in real life which use those pseudo anonymous wallets. 

And yeah, I hate my tax money being wasted on government corruption and incompetence as much as the next guy I don't think decentralization will fix anything as it's addressing a seperate issue.

megahz21,"My Thoughts Day2.
With almost anything new, the ""initial"" technical language used is sometimes weak in description and might be missing key data or terminology to describe the technical and social goals of the products design and structure.

Maybe we can start a new thread to break down the Original white paper or start a bigger discussion on the semantics of the words and their meanings and intentions so we can fill the gap on understanding.
Example: white paper has language like ""longest chain?"" and other things like ""secure"" but lets break that down..
Secure?= secure as in people can not access unauthorized data or secure as in I can confirm my data is true and correct or secure data can't be lost, ect..

Largest blockchain?=??

I think it might be easier to consider the tru meanings for the intent of the initial design and when it was created..

Example: the language used to create the ""genesis block"" and the initial goals of the products design.. ""In Times Chancellor,, ect""..
Bitcoin was created as an experiment because a new system needed to be researched to replace having to repeatedly bail out failed institutions that fail again and again because of personal greed, shortsightedness and of the cannibalistic nature of the of the system itself.. 

So Bitcoin initial intent was allowed to?
1. try to make transactions fast and transparent so you and everyone ells can see the ""same finalized transaction on a public ledger"".
2. test future concept to bring transaction time as close to T0 as possible, T3 is a joke and heaven for failure to fester..
3. Test a system to put stock market on a chain so there is less time to exploit and leave a need for people to loss their trade at settlement. less chance world collapse from everyone owns nothing. 30 day settlements-not funny.. I can claim its mine for 30 days, even though I immediately sold and never had anything to after day1&gt;&gt;someones going to loose out..
4. ?

So where are we at, with the bitcoin name? now I see a name Blockstream? who are they, I need to do more research on all of the unnecessary fighting.. and talk of bitcoin being rewired for slow settlements, something not right!

I think that's a counteraction s the initial intent of the bitcoin idea and will only bring more destruction to what needs fixing!.?*&amp;%^&amp;%$%!! , oh crap my spider senses are tingling, its all a conspiracy! lol...

Purpleflower88,"## **Erotic stories brought to life | Adult VideoBooks | KiK for later+**

I started out calling these ""Kik for later+"", because they share some similarities, but ""Adult VideoBooks"" or ""Erotic stories brought to life"" serves it better. They are created by using a sexy written erotic story combined with pictures and videos of me living the life of Emma. It is quite unique and different from a normal kik session. These VideoBooks are the result of a joined effort between Sienna Rose, a friend/erotica writer, and myself ('actress' of the movies and pictures)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **But what is it?**

* A personalised *(using your first name)* erotic story (written), featuring myself (Emma), you and sometimes some other characters, combined with pictures and videos that match the story, bringing it to life

* The text and pictures will be delivered in an order so that you can read a bit of text, look at a matching picture, read a bit more, look at a matching video, etc. You will be able to re-use the VideoBook at a later time to enjoy it again as often as you like.

* But since this is quite a new concept, **[here's a preview!](http://0djmfskjfdqsmldjflmsjdf.blogspot.be/2017/12/emma-smiled-happily-as-she-closed.html)** If you like what you read and see here, you're gonna love the stories!

&amp;nbsp;

## **Current stories**

#### **1. Emma's escort agency experience [$25]**

* Emma has been divorced for 9 months after being married for 10+ years and never experienced an orgasm. A friend convinces her to use an escort agency to change that. The things she experiences, she never thought possible...

* ~ 30 mins worth of content; 7 pics &amp; 11 vids (~ 3 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **2. Emma gets mind controlled and turned into a sex slave [$28]**

* Emma realizes the world has a lot to show her that she has never opened herself up to see. She needs this to change, and (wrongfully?) trusts the first person offering to show her a whole new world. She gets strung along, mind controlled and eventually turned into a sex slave...

* ~ 30 mins worth of content; 6 pics &amp; 12 vids (~ 7 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **3. Emma's husband finally returns home from prison [$30]**

* Emma's husband is released from prison after being wrongfully convicted. She is ready for him, waiting at home, with just an apron and heels on ... But is he ready for her? 

* ~ 45 mins worth of content; 5 pics &amp; 13 vids (~ 11 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **4. Emma marries rich, but wealth isn't everything... [$28]**

* Emma marries a rich entrepreneur, but it turns out money isn't everything. Her husband can't give her what she needs, but his son can give her something she needs badly, but should they...? Can they resist the urge? Oh stepmom, we shouldn't do this!

* ~ 30 mins worth of content; 5 pics &amp; 13 vids (~ 7 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **5. Emma gone BAD! üî•NEWüî• [$35]**

* Emma used to be a good girl, but this all changes in a very short trip with her friend ""Lusty Lorna"". Naked sunbathing, her first blowjob, her first anal, ... she ends up cheating on her husband twice... And... He's happy about it!  The things she learned...

* ~ 60 mins worth of content; 9 pics &amp; 21 vids (~ 18 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **Your own custom theme**

Would you prefer a custom VideoBook based exactly on your request? That's also possible. Please keep in mind it kan take upto 2 weeks to create. The price varies, but is around $50 - $75

&amp;nbsp;

**Bundle Deals:** Get 20% off if you buy 2 stories and 30% if you buy 3

&amp;nbsp;

## **Rather have me rate your cock or cumshot??**

I recently started doing cock &amp; cumshot ratings as well, due to popular demand of the way I write. Want me to let you know what I think about your cock? What I would or wouldn't do with it? Do you think you're big enough for me? **$15** for a lengthy written cock or cumshot rating!

Apocrypton,"Honestly this is the first time period I have been uncomfortable giving predictions, there are just so many variables at play now compared to previous years. I believe without regulation or outside influence we could be back to ATHs by June, and coins with actual products being used will pull away from the pack. A lot of it depends on the Asian markets in my opinion, if they create another buying frenzy and draw more investors in we could have another insane rally before then. 

We really need bitcoin to recover in order to swing public opinion back to bullish, and exchanges to reopen unlimited registrations if we want to see that insanity again.

My predictions aren't any more valid than most, but barring regulation I believe it will be a huge year for useful cryptos and a rough one for shitcoins. I am hesitant to give an actual number, but I believe that BTC at 30k and ETH at 4500 is a semi reasonable expectation by EOY (barring a concerted regulatory push) 

I have consolidated into coins that are currently in use (except ENJ) with the expectation that 2018 will be less speculative than 2017, with a heavier focus on fundamental use cases. ",dtjhj9a,2,1/31/2018 15:58,,,,,,

DigiCash Inc. was an electronic money corporation founded by David Chaum in 1989.

gizram84,"&gt; The point is that 0-conf transactions are viable if the cost to attack exceeds the value of the transaction.

Double spend attacks actually cost nothing at all.  Just create two versions of a tx in advance and broadcast them spread out by a few minutes.

&gt; I don't think the extra complexity of the lightning network gives much benefit

Users don't have to worry about complexity.  Software handles that.  The concept of Bitcoin itself is extremely complex; elliptical curve cryptography, cryptographic hash functions, etc.  Users are shielded from the complexity with nice UIs.

But you can't pretend that Lightning doesn't give much benefit.  That's an insane position to take.  Lightning txs are cryptographically secure, and cannot be double spent.  They are truly instant, something that no other blockchain can claim.  Even ethereum has 12-14 second blocks.  Litecoin and Vertcoin have 2.5 minute blocks.  Bitcoin and BCH have 10 minute blocks.  Lightning tx are *instant*.  Wasn't that BCH's entire point?  That txs took too long to confirm?  Then you want to pretend that truly instant txs are not that great?

There are blocks every 10 minutes, doesn't matter how many transactions are in them.

rustyshacklefordton,"Different consensus models offer different properties. If you are transferring tiny units of value between your fridge and microwave then iota tangle will be perfect as it is fast and fee-less and it is not worth an attackers time. If you're transferring half a billion in bitcoin, you'll want the mathematical certainty that 6 confirmations gives your transaction, backed by the enormous amount of hash power that btc has amassed. If you need a highly censorship resistant and moderately fast smart contract transaction then maybe Eths full pos may be ideal. If you're running a decentralized twitter then maybe a dpos system is okay as it is less critical.

One of the most unique consensus mechanisms out there is with decred, where pow blocks are also validated with a pos system that allows decred holders to participate in the consensus mechanism. Not only does this add an extra layer of security against double spends, it also allows for a governance system where hard forks can be enforced at a protocol level, and the dev fund can be run as a full on chain dao. Neat stuff. 

The point is each consensus mechanism has its tradeoffs and will likely find a niche in the ecosystem. Intrachain Protocols like cosmos and polkadot will help these consensus mechanisms mesh and develop a fully functional web 3.0.

fruitsofknowledge,"Yes. Although that obviously doesn't mean that it necessarily couldn't be done (at least indirectly) and especially not that the recent RBF is a better solution.

Satoshi had many functions in Bitcoin that were not yet revealed or fully completed, so he may very well have been looking at a solution. But considering that he thought it should happen long into the future, he probably had more important things to work on and discuss.

(Edit: It should already obvious, but it's possible that Satoshi didn't mean _exactly_ the same, but rather the same except for the fee itself and importantly _still_ in a manner that didn't ruin zconf transactions that he had explained in the snack machine thread. It should however not be ruled out entirely that he had an even more advanced solution in mind. -This was not intended point of the thread anyhow, but to show where RBF goes wrong.)",dtjh2tk,2,1/31/2018 15:51,,,,,,

Joe_Melon,"Hi Crippetoe, thanks for reaching out. This topic has been addressed on many occasions and on behalf of the core team I can tell you that we do understand your concern. Privacy is very important for all the members of the team. This is not because when we need to exit scam, we leave without a trace. If that was the intention, the easy route was to go for an ICO and walk away with millions, and not work on reviving an old coin from 2014. Remaining anonymous is important because there is the matter of safety. Nobody want to be on the receiving end of threats and harassment from people who made bad trading decisions or inflated predictions. Crimes related to crypto are beginning to make the news. I‚Äôs sending one i came across the other day. The people in the team need to feel safe first and foremost to continue development on the project. That is not negotiable.

Moreover, in the spirit of decentralisation, I feel that one does not need to know the identities of the people working on an open source project. That‚Äôs the whole point of Satoshi still remaining anonymous. The adoption will speak for itself. If identity drove the value of the coin, then its a failure before it even started. We‚Äôre all volunteers who organically took control over things that needed improvement, and the only thing we have in common is honesty and loyalty. All the team members come from different countries with different backgrounds, yet we function with synergy as one team even though we ourselves don‚Äôt know the identity of other team members. We chose to work like that intentionally, and like to look at it like a ‚Äúcompany culture‚Ä?more than anything.

Deliphin,"No, his argument is that your argument is entirely hypocritical.

You claim that Cryptocurrencies are worthless because they're fiat. Because they have no physical backing. You make no additional claims that further that claim.

Then you agree that the USD is fiat currency. But we all know that USD has a worth. Yet you persist the claim that the fact that Cryptocurrency is fiat is why it's worthless.

If you really went though basic economics, you'd know that worth isn't based on the government, it's based on people. If many people are willing to spend $10,000 on 1 bitcoin, then bitcoin is worth $10,000. Therefore bitcoin has worth, despite being a fiat currency.

You're literally saying that Bitcoin and USD are the same thing, yet bitcoin is worthless because of that, while USD has value despite that. That's not possible.

Hell, if you really want to see the extent of how far fiat can be, there are a couple TF2 hats worth tens of thousands of dollars. People are willing to pay it, so it is worth that. That's as close to being worthless as something can be, and yet that has worth.

The only way you could possibly see your own argument as correct is if you saw modern currency like USD as being worthless.

TrekkieGod,"&gt;You're right, I should have paid more attention to the username. I apologize totally.

That's fair, it happens. I overreacted too.

&gt;No, that's a false equivalency. The other person was saying the equivalent of ""I hope there's an avalanche that wipes out XYZ resort so I can go skiiing again; I know it'll happen eventually, but I'd like it to happen as soon as possible so I can hit the slope""

That's fair comparison, but even then I what I tried to argue is that if people are going to ""lose their homes, savings, etc"" on a cryptocurrency market, then they built that resort on an avalanche-prone mountain, and they keep building it up, and inviting more guests over.

It's not just cryptocurrency. Nobody should put any amount of money that they're not willing to completely and utterly lose on a single company's stock, or even a single industry. Hedging is a **very** important part of responsible investing. In that sense, if we ignore your point about his GPU motivations (which are valid from a purely ethical standpoint), the earlier a bad crash happens, the less people will be hurt. It's better that resort get wiped out when it has 20 guests than when it's big enough that it has 200 guests. So you're hoping for a bad thing that benefits you that is better than the worst thing that would also benefit you, but later.

I don't think we really disagree on much here, if anything. My basic point is that although I will feel bad for everyone that is hurt by the eventual cryptocurrency crash, it's important to put the blame on where it lies: those people are investing irresponsibly. I don't want them to be hurt, but it is entirely their fault that they will get hurt.

EDIT: I think another valid point is that there's a futures market on bitcoin now, which makes the entire ethical 'hope' perspective much more complex. So there are people shorting the value of the currency. If you hope that market never crashes, you're essentially hoping that the people who irresponsibly shorted it and can't afford to lose that money lose their homes and savings on a successful market.

Basically, hoping the market crashes or doesn't crash can be completely independent of hoping for bad things to happen to people. I hope the number of irresponsible investors is low, and that most of the people who are invested in the success and the people who are invested in the failure of this particular market are sufficiently diversified that overall their total investment will grow in the long run.",dtjgor3,2,1/31/2018 15:45,,,,,,

I was wondering about the problems that can arise from bigger block sizes, because I kept seeing people saying it's a bad thing for security, etc.  
I wanted to see arguments for both sides of the coin ;)  
Right after posting that comment, I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJm2ep3X_M) about the scaling of Bitcoin. They tested up to 1 GB blocks.  
Then I found this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g&amp;) explaining the current situation with BTC.  
Very interesting stuff.  
  
I also keep seeing arguments about Roger Ver being a scammer (and that being a problem for BCH), Segwit disabling an advantage that Bitmain has patented, etc. and was wondering what people think of it, and if they think those are not true, how can they make sure of it? (I don't have an opinion about these. Don't know enough)

chodpaba,"&gt;A crypto with no direct pairing to fiat has a value that is the function of the price of the crypto it must go through to get to fiat.

This is the fatal flaw to your logic. Because crypto is **always** paired with fiat. There are hard costs for mining and development, there are hard costs to investors for trading. In the U.S., for instance, crypto trading no longer qualifies as a like-kind exchange. But the real battle is in the minds of investors who will continue to value your crypto in dollar terms which perception is perpetuated by the exchanges, Coinmarketcap, regulators, and banks as long as those intermediaries are part of the loop. The fiat/crypto pairing is ubiquitous, and cryptos as a class are valued together in terms of fiat. The 'gateway' can be Bitcoin, Ether, or Dogecoin, it matters not.

**Author**:  _CryptoRando_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;There was another decentralized movement that was based on consensus. It was a time of hope. It was a time of the future.

&gt;That movement was Occupy Wall Street, and it buckled under the pressure of infighting, indecision, and ignorance.

&gt;Segregated Witness and Lightning Network, you say. Schorr√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Signatures, you say. HODL, you say.

&gt;Let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s be real here.

&gt;Bitcoin is a public ledger, and secondary protocol is being placed over it to give people the anonymity and speed they require. But what if I told you that Bitcoin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s main strength comes from its public ledger?

&gt;The very nature of corruption is boiled down to the clandestine world of political finance, and a machine oiled by the transparency of bitcoin would bring hope back to the planet.

&gt;We already have the consensus mechanisms that they lacked, and God knows we also have the longevity.

&gt;We can game the political process by incentivizing participation and turning donations into a investment opportunity. Why donate to a traditional political campaign when you can stake your coins on a candidate and use the proceeds to fund their success? 

&gt;Citizens of countries can be incentivized to vote, call their representatives, go door to door, or any other political duties that would help the movement.

&gt;We finally have the technology to achieve what many Americans experienced when Obama was voted into office, but now, we have the tools to tailor the flow of funding wherever the community desires. We don't have to be at the whim of party over country, or country over citizen.

&gt;You tell me there is no use case. Well, I say the true use case hasn't been appreciated yet.

&gt;In every nation on earth, there is a battle to be fought. The wolves of the world fill our bags with money so we feel comfortable enough to take out a mortgage. This is then followed by shady financial practices which crashes the world economy. Rinse and repeat.

&gt;Last night, Trump called on the members of Congress for a federal spending bill leveraged by private sector investments.

&gt;This sounds awfully familiar.

&gt;Andreas Antonopoulos warned us that the same entities who crashed the world economy with shady default swaps are doing the same thing again, and Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s speech last night was a validation for things to come.

&gt;So let us come together and understand why we are here in the first place.

&gt;The power for financial revolution is here, so let us be a little more optimistic and open-minded on application and use-case. Let us utilize a diversity of tactics to reach a destination where digital consensus mechanisms have an effect on an analog world. 

&gt;Let us free society from the clutches of power and corruption.",dtjg3s9,2,1/31/2018 15:36,,,,,,

1) Theory and practice. In theory, a fully decentralized network with no central authority/governing body would be great if effective decisions can be made and the network can evolve and adapt to the needs of society efficiently. In practice, well, bitcoin. One can run into gridlock, or the rate at which important decisions and adaptations can be made is hampered by the very nature of the system.

2) Sort of goes along the lines of #1 but the argument can then be made that a hybrid system  with elements of decentralization and elements of centralization could possibly be better. E.g: a public protocol with one or multiple governing entities (private or otherwise) that help speed development (see: The United States, Tezos, etc.). Some good that‚Äôs done so far... 

With that said, some argue Ethereum is no better with development being mostly held in the hands of few while most just own shares. I don‚Äôt personally agree, the distribution of developers is a fair bit more even across multiple developing parties with different agendas.",dtjg1zo,2,1/31/2018 15:36,,,,,,

Just look at those proofs of adoption (already happening on loopchain that will become part of ICON when all those standalone blockchains are merged into ICON):

*Adopted by bank and two 26 Korean securities - https://medium.com/helloiconworld/banknote-e-currency-issue-our-silver-first-step-4237922dd9e5

*Adopted by 3 universities and already a vending machine placed there - http://news.joins.com/article/22235404

*Hospitals, Insurance ....etc

Like it or not, those people that will soon go to those hospitals will have their record kept on ICON, those that attend the universities as well. Plus probably many more industries coming.

Hashes/s is a work measure adjusted only by the difference in algorithm and how efficient the chips are - eg how much long term capital has been spent to build a moat against new attackers.

I don't know how different the work to achieve an eth has vs a btc hash is, but I'd guess less than an order of magnitude. The hashrates on the other hand are different by 5 orders of magnitude. So even if we're generous, and say an eth hash takes 100x more work to compute than a btc hash, btc is still 1000x harder to attack at the moment.

Mining revenues of ETH could change this long term, but it will change it by incentivizing ASIC design, production, and installation, and *then* ETH would be as hard to attack as bitcoin.",dtjfrwq,2,1/31/2018 15:31,,,,,,

Kain_niaK,"BCH is allowed to grow naturally like how Satoshi outlined in his vision (nobody is in control, bitcoin works and brings order amongst chaos). BTC devs have artificially limited it's growth. With BCH we do our best as a community so that no one takes control over it. (the math is in charge) With BTC one company called blockstream has gained some control over it. (they claim Satoshi his math was wrong) 

Conclusion: Satoshi wanted to create an instrument of freedom. This freedom can be found way more with BCH than with BTC. Therefore BCH is more true to Satoshi his vision. BTC is less true to  Satoshi his vision. If you need proof of this just go to the BTC community and ask them some hard questions and be a bit critical and see what happens. 

Over at /r/bitcoin everything you see and hear with your own eyes will tell you that BTC is an investment, like stock. Here at /r/btc BCH is also an investment but their are way more people around that want to use BCH as the best payment system the world has ever build and a a new (digital native) currency. These things are true! When you get this difference (it's not even subtle) and when you understand that investing in numbers with not much utility to back up the numbers .... well .... then you start slowly becoming more like satoshi. 

All crypto are in the race to become the first global currency but there can only be one. We of the BCH community believe in Satoshi his vision first and only. We want to give that vision 100% a chance, which might take 3 or 4 decades or even longer and requires hard work of every Satoshi. (all Satoshis are equal, 1 sat = 1 sat) 

As soon as people understand that, they themselves become Satoshi. Satoshi did not have to explicitly state this. But this is how good ideas become viruses (positive) of the mind and spread from one mind to another mind. We are all Satoshi but we need more Satoshis. Go out and make some Satoshis. Best way of making Satoshis is to use Bitcoin in the way it was intended and show people the benefits of this radical and revolutionary new way of dealing with new money. This is fresh new money that has not gone through the corrupted hearts and hands of the powerful elite on this planet. That means something especially to the people that are sick of the corruption in the old system! 

To say it with a very clich√© quote:

&gt;Satoshi is an idea, and ideas are bulletproof

In our case it is


&gt;Satoshi is a good idea, and good ideas are blockstream proof


As a community with no leader other then one good idea we expose the bitcoin hijackers and it won't be long before all their power is broken. And Bitcoin Cash will stay Bitcoin Cash. Names are important. Bitcoin was intended and invented to be like Cash. 
Not as an investment or a store of value ... those are possible byproducts. When they become the main goal the idea just won't make it.  The main goal and idea is still to have a one world currency that nobody controls .... so that the elite on this planet cannot launch theirs ... that they control.  Satoshi knew this so well and wrapped it all up so good in his idea that he did not even had to explicitly mention this. He ministered this idea for about 2 years and then disappeared forever. 

&gt; My child is growing up strong and my work is done. 

We are all Satoshi is the worst news that any elite member of our society can hear. The KNOW what that can mean for them and their power. Forget occupy wallstreet. When we-are-all-Satoshi is done, and the 99% are all Satoshis those walls will be gone and the street will be deserted. Adjust or die, their choice.

biglambda,"Ask yourself this question, are any of your theories based in what happens empirically or are you just putting out theories that never seem to play out in reality? It's clearly the latter.

&gt; No, but informing you that the value of Bitcoin is only so high on paper because the HODL meme is so deeply ingrained into people that almost nobody is selling, which leads to a small amount of coins being bid on by a lot of people, is not effective. 

The HODL meme has been in full swing since 2014. There has been no change in peoples willingness to hodl.

&gt; That makes the market extremely susceptible to huge changes in value from only a small change in demand. Only a small fraction of the people that you said would still be able to make a profit even if value dropped would be able to cash out before they actually realise any gain at all.

No one says you will make a profit. People say to only spend as much as you can afford to lose and to **H**old **O**n for **D**ear **L**ife. The giant black swan event where everyone dumps their bitcoins down to zero is a religious rapture myth of this cult. It in fact becomes less likely with each market cycle, not more likely. 

&gt; Bitcoin also costs less than the cost of electricity to produce a single coin in a lot of countries right now, which is bad because if there is no incentive to mine, there's nobody to process transactions and people cannot get out of the market regardless.

Miners may mine at a loss for a short time but they will turn off equipment when it becomes unprofitable. When that happens the difficulty adjusts down until it is profitable again. This happened in 2014 and it will happen again in the next bear market. It sounds to me like you need to learn how Bitcoin works.

There is also a whole range of services offered now so expect more developers to be working on projects like Neo and ethereum that are trying to digitise assets or the supply chain coins.

I've been in bitcoin since 2013. This is my second bubble! 

Anyway I suggest you look at the bitcoin price charts from 2009 onwards. It's history is replete with bubbles and bear markets. bitcoincharts.com is a good site for this sort of thing. 

I especially recommend that you take a look at december 2013 and full year 2014 graphs. You will see that the price rose throughout 2013 and then the bubble burst before Christmas. After that it was a slow bleed down. We saw the exact same pattern this time. Price rose throughout 2017, bubble bursts at Christmas when traders cash out and then its a slow bleed down. Bitcoin markets are heavily manipulated so that's why we are seeing the same pattern repeat itself.",dtjfcne,2,1/31/2018 15:25,,,,,,

Fobiza,"BMO supports it. Im in the process of switching banks due to the same issue and the gentleman at the branch also buys and trades crypto using his own BMO account. He shows me the guide that Nesbitt Burns (head of the investment team) wrote to educate the employees on the rudimentary of crypto currency.

It seems they are embracing its potential instead of foaming at the mouth like other canadian banks. 

Here is what he sent;

A message from the BMO Nesbitt Burns Portfolio Advisory Team: This article is designed to provide awareness about virtual
currencies, also referred to as ‚Äúcryptocurrencies.‚Ä?We acknowledge that the value of bitcoin and other virtual currencies
has increased exponentially over a relatively short period of time. These dramatic increases in value are viewed as both a
flag of caution, and area worthy of further research. As a team, we currently do not support virtual currency trading given
the information we have available. However, we do believe it is valuable to remain knowledgeable as market dynamics
continue to be affected by technological change and emerging tech investment themes.
An Introduction to Bitcoin and Other Virtual Currencies
What is a virtual currency?
All virtual currencies are also digital currencies or digital
money, and do not exist in a tangible form, meaning they
are accessed and transacted with electronically. A virtual
currency differs from a digital currency by the way in which it
is issued and supported, as well as its usability. Decentralized
virtual currencies utilize cryptography to secure their record of
transactions, which are stored in an online publically available
ledger called a blockchain. An example of a blockchain is Bitcoin
(capital B, Bitcoin), which is the name of both the underlying
technology and the unit of virtual currency itself (lower case b,
bitcoin). Bitcoin is the world‚Äôs first blockchain and has existed
for just over nine years. Entries recorded on a blockchain
such as the Bitcoin are considered to be immutable (i.e., very
difficult to tamper with or change without the decentralized
Bitcoin community knowing). Other examples of decentralized
blockchains are Ethereum and Litecoin, which share some
similarities with Bitcoin.
Depending on whom you ask, virtual currencies can be
considered a currency, an asset, or a commodity, similar to
gold. Arguably, virtual currencies have similar characteristics
to traditional fiat currencies (i.e., a store of value, a medium of
exchange, and a unit of account). Unlike traditional currencies,
virtual currencies are not controlled or regulated by any single
authority and are, therefore, decentralized. Transactions are
conducted in a peer-to-peer network without the need for
intermediaries such as central banks or financial institutions.
Virtual currencies, such as bitcoin, can be used to purchase
goods and services or to hold as a store of value, and transfer
value seamlessly across international borders. At the moment,
there are more than one thousand operational virtual
currencies, each offering something different.
How does supply work?
Virtual currency ‚Äúminers‚Ä?run powerful computer processors that
serve to verify transactions on the blockchain protocol. Mining
is incentivized through the concurrent creation of new currency
units rewarded to the miners for successful verification. Think of
miners as a classroom of students taking a math quiz every 10
minutes, with the first student to achieve 100 per cent receiving
a reward of newly minted currency units each time. (Keep
in mind that not all virtual currencies operate on the same
mining protocol, and some lesser known virtual currencies have
eliminated the mining process altogether.)
Bitcoin is one such virtual currency that requires the mining
process; however, the total number of units that can be
created is limited, much like the total available supply of gold.
In the case of Bitcoin, the total supply is capped at 21 million,
but with this being said each bitcoin is divisible by 100 million
with its smallest divisible unit referred to as a ‚ÄúSatoshi.‚Ä?The
last bitcoins are anticipated to be mined in 2140 with incentive
then moving solely to the monetization of the verification
process, as opposed to the creation of new units.
 
How does demand work?
Once created, virtual currencies can be used to trade or
conduct transactions in the global economy, with more and
more retailers and businesses accepting virtual currencies by
the day. Typically, virtual currencies are accessed through a
user‚Äôs virtual currency wallet held on a virtual exchange or
hard wallet device (similar to a USB stick.) These are accessible
via mobile phone or laptop computer. Each wallet contains the
user‚Äôs public and private keys. The public key is similar to an
email address and the private key is effectively the password.
In using the Bitcoin blockchain as an example, a transaction
will state, ‚ÄúJohn gives ‚ÄòX number‚Ä?of bitcoin to Sarah.‚Ä?This
transaction is signed (approved) by John‚Äôs private key and
sent to Sarah‚Äôs public key (wallet address). After verification
by the miners, the transaction is completed and added as
part of a block to the Bitcoin blockchain. This block will house
certain information confirming the transaction took place
alongside other transactions bundled together with it. Not all
transactional information is stored in the block; however, the
approximate time stamp of when the transaction took place
and the wallet addresses of those involved (not the names of
the individuals) are included.
Buying and selling bitcoin and other virtual
currencies
Individuals currently cannot purchase or sell bitcoin and other
virtual currencies from their local bank branch or through
their financial professionals. Generally, virtual currencies
are purchased and sold via a third party exchange, such as
Coinbase, foreign brokerage, Bitcoin ATM, or peer-to-peer
website such as Local Bitcoins. Typically, users will create a
wallet linked to their bank account or credit card to purchase
and sell virtual currencies. Some exchanges and brokerages
will accept wires, e-mail money transfers, and other payment
methods, and the rates between buyers and sellers can differ
significantly. Bitcoin ATMs (‚ÄúBTMs‚Ä?, generally only accept cash
and charge higher fees for their convenience. However, BTMs
typically have limits on the amount of virtual currency units that
can be purchased. While there are many ways to purchase and
sell, the use of blockchain technology ensures there is only one
ledger, per virtual currency, recording all of the transactions.
The use of virtual currencies continues to grow as the
emerging digital economy gains prominence in Canada and
worldwide. We encourage investors to stay informed as
technological advances that marry currency and the online
sphere become more accessible.

This is a classic direct comparison, and he by no means mention market cap. 

My argument is simple. It's incorrect to compare NEO to Nano because they address two different things.

To be brazen, if you compare something like Monero to VeChain, then you are ignorant. One is a privatized blockchain that is currency-like, and the other is a platform for supply chain and applications.

But hey, sell your Bitcoin because it doesn't have any corporate partnerships in its 'roadmap'. I guess that makes sense.

I saw one person who said they sold their claim but they intend to pursue the right to all forks as they were not part of the claim. Would you be relinquishing the right to all forks, future and past?

How many bitcoin did you have in your claim and how much fiat? (figures for each please).

Raja_Rancho,"I am sorry you wrote a long lost explaining that but market cap is simply not related to the price once it starts getting manipulated like that. See the deviations between price and mcap on the graph for yourself. And even if that's been bloated the price according to the scarcity and how many Bitcoin is distributed on the immutable public ledger is not going to change. That is the price full stop there's no betting on top of fiat like shorts and CDOs that's already not based on anything kind of multiplying bubble here. 

Keep thinking in stock market and fiat terms and making the same mistake. You will have to rethink the whole thing with a currency on the blockchain as its basis. Mcap and 24 h volume can be very easily manipulated by whales, the price of btc cannot. Yes dumb people who believe that theory will sell and bring the price down in very very short term, but assuming all of them are out by the last two crashes, I reckon bitcoin should function, with its publicly available and trusted value on the blockchain once again.

What bitcoin needs to become stable is widespread usage and backing. And this is happening, albeit slowly. Bitcoin in my eyes will always be a terrible currency as long as it's white paper.

juste1221,"That the media and people haven't picked up on this after this long and an untold numbers of stories/headlines later is willful ignorance.  The entire premise of crypto, its value, and demand is intrinsically rooted in running on everyday hardware and systems.  This is what spawned the Altcoin boom in the first place.  Several years ago when Bitcoins shifted entirely to ASIC's and professional mining operations, it's value/demand has continued to be driven by home GPU's/CPU's.  That is, people created alt coins they could mine, which they then converted to Bitcoin (and vise versa), which in turned increased BTC demand and value.  In the absence of home mining alt coins, Bitcoin likely would have cratered as a handful of controlling parties manuipulated it into the ground.  Altcoins are the check and balance as it were.  These stories are idiotic, ASIC's aren't going to do shit for GPU prices or demand.  They'll actually increase both for the reasons detailed above.",dtjf0qd,2,1/31/2018 15:20,,,,,,
DoktorSpooderman,"Counter-opinion, though I see the validity in points you made: 

1)The eventual fixed supply of ETH (once transitioned to POS) is being priced in, with a nod to the fact that the rate of creation of new ETH tokens is counterbalanced by the burn rate such that supply fluctuations won‚Äôt matter substantially in the short or long term. So store of value is somewhat priced in. That alone wouldn‚Äôt make it a better store of value over bitcoin, but that + better liquidity + smart contracts/better utility would.

2) Sharding, Raiden, Plasma, POS, other scaling endeavors seem to be more robust in terms of how many developers are working on each, and how far along they are. Multiple approaches are developing in parallel. No doubt, all speculation until proven otherwise, but it seems there is more to show for at the moment.

3) Dapps will take time. Some are getting closer. These will need 1) and 2) to be addressed as well.


‚ÄúOvervalued‚Ä?is relative. If compared to bitcoin, well given that market price is a reflection of perceived value then maybe it isn‚Äôt if ETH fundamentals are improving over bitcoin‚Äôs.

Political nonsense absolutely matters in a market discussion. You think the winners and losers of this crazy race will be determined on technological merit alone? You're more bonkers than I thought.

Online communities like this one are often echo chambers. Go to literally any coin subreddit and you'll find thousands of people proclaiming that particular technology is going to change the world. They aren't. I'm with Vitalik on this one, 90% of these coins are going to die.

And I know there's more to bitcoin than storage of wealth, and there's more to gold too. But I'm not talking about someones small investment, I'm talking about 100's of millions of dollars. That's what matters when we're talking about bitcoin.

techknowledgy,"&gt; I think ""professional idiot"" is the accepted term.

I'll take it. There's a lot of professions that could apply to as well. If you read my work, it's obvious that I don't take it super serious or subscribe to the cult-like mentality. As a consultant in general it is best to be able to see all sides, both positive and negative, and present them to your client on the outcomes of different courses of action.

Regarding BFL, I guess you could say it was exciting. I'm not really sure. It's easy to look back on it now, but there was some really hard days waking up and looking in the mirror. That was the most money I had ever made in my life at that time though, but it didn't feel good knowing where it came from.

I was definitely not oblivious to their reputation at that time in 2013 and the fact that I was coming in when they were nearly six months late already on delivery. My uncle worked there as the Acct Mgr though, thanks in part to him picking my brain for knowledge about Bitcoin, and he seemed to indicate it was overblown. I think it took a week before I started realizing there were problems, and just a little bit longer to realize that they were either intentional or symptoms of severe mismanagement.

I persevered and tried to do what was best for the customers and be the voice of reason, but that didn't go over too well after a little while.

I'll never forget what the impetus was for me leaving. A soldier in the US Army, which I served in, was retiring and wanted to spend all of his retirement bonus on Mini rigs. I couldn't do it. I couldn't tell that guy to buy a product at my own company and that was enough. I told him to stay the hell away and gave my two weeks notice.

I don't want to give too much away as I'm thinking about writing a book and I've always planned one. There is a lot of shit that went down around the early Bitcoin mining Asic days that I think people would find interesting.",dtjezzw,2,1/31/2018 15:20,,,,,,

Ardarail,"I would say a lot of it is just due to the fact that bitcoin is the public face of cryptos. Its name is synonymous with cryptos for the ""normies"" (general population). Therefore it saw the largest increase in casual/inexperienced investors and is also most likely to be negatively affected by FUD caused by media and general market downtrends. It's where the public eye is at, whereas ethereum is not nearly as prevalent in the general populations' minds and received far less direct criticism from media etc.",dtjeuh7,2,1/31/2018 15:18,,,,,,

StrawCentrist,"No, but informing you that the value of Bitcoin is only so high on paper because the HODL meme is so deeply ingrained into people that almost nobody is selling, which leads to a small amount of coins being bid on by a lot of people, is not effective. That makes the market extremely susceptible to huge changes in value from only a small change in demand. Only a small fraction of the people that you said would still be able to make a profit even if value dropped would be able to cash out before they actually realise any gain at all. 

Bitcoin also costs less than the cost of electricity to produce a single coin in a lot of countries right now, which is bad because if there is no incentive to mine, there's nobody to process transactions and people *cannot* get out of the market regardless.",dtjetk7,2,1/31/2018 15:17,,,,,,

She had to borrow money from friends to pay her debt so she can get her account unfrozen to pay off to her friends..
It just sounds redicolous to me that she didn't have access to her own money.

**Author**:  _s1lentparr0t_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;By not increasing the block size the freedom feature of Bitcoin is getting damaged. You need to pay much higher fees.
But there's no reason to think an increase would centralize Bitcoin.

&gt;Satoshi never thought that increasing the block size is a problem:


&gt;if (blocknumber &gt; 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit

&gt;It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that 
block number and goes into effect, the older versions 
that don't have it are already obsolete. When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old 
versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;And here's why Bitcoin should increase block size whenever it's needed:


&gt;By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows &gt; at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay &gt;ahead of the number of transactions.

Everybody parroting: ""The bitcoin bubble is about to pop"" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is exponential.
So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020, since it came from less than $1 to $10,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential 'S-Curve' of adoption.

&gt; CEO is on record saying that the whole point behind the ICO was to do another round of fundraising for Kik Messenger (this was their 6th) without diluting anyone's (previous investor's) ownership equity. In the same interview he said the ICO would also serve as a way for past investors to make an exit [if they no longer believed in the product's success.]
&gt; 
&gt; And it worked. The ICO made the company as much money as all 5 of their previous funding rounds combined ~$95 million. 
&gt; 
&gt; Further, while they won't admit it, the massive coin supply of 10 trillion was created to always keep prices insanely low (tiny fraction of a cent) so people who have no clue about cryptos will latch onto it because they can get thousands of coins for $100 or whatever.

We continue to remain open from 
feedback from our members to how we risk 
managing the process.

And so we are happy to engage in 
discussions on that.
 

 One point I would make on the risk 
committees.

I think that's a valid group of people to 
consult.

I'm not sure that's a comprehensive group 
of people to represent.

They're not a representative sample of all 
clearing firms and constituent firms.
 

 The Chair recognizes Marcus Stanley.
 

 I think from a public interest 
perspective we always get concerned when 
clearing members publicly raise an issue 
about risk management at the clearing 
houses they are members of.

It's hard to see what the incentive would 
be to do if there's not actually a problem.

Even though we don't agree with clearing 
members with all of their positions.

On this raising an issue on risk 
management we consider that on red flag 
and the fact that it has come up in this case 
does point to issues in concern in 
self-certification.
 

 The Chair recognizes Richard Miller.
 

 Yeah.

To your second question, Paul, about how 
the CFTC surveils or risk manages on an 
ongoing basis.

I had a thought that was -- that came to 
mind when I was reading professor Kyle's 
resum√É¬©.

We have something in common that goes 
back to the 1987 crash.

And at that time, the poster child of the 
'87 was stock index futures because of the 
product that was popularized in the markets 
called portfolio insurance.

Portfolio insurance assumed you'd be 
able to execute insurance into a decline 
market.

It was sold as a risk management tool to 
financial management user.

But the overhang of the potential use of 
portfolio insurance would have not been 
reflected in the interest but was a product 
hanging outside of the market you would 
have have been able to see that.

So the cautionary tale you take away from 
that.

Ongoing surveillance has to anecdotal 
evidence what's out there that's being 
packaged in financial products that might be 
sold on an ongoing basis and popularized it 
seems to intuitively the mystery around 
Bitcoin has the same kind of magical charm 
that portfolio insurance had in stock index 
futures back in the 1980s.

They might become an attractive financial 
product packaged up as a means of 
hedging.

You may not see as a product in the 
market because it's an overhang.

So my cautionary remark the CFTC 
needs to be aware what's out there that may 
not reflected in the open interest and what's 
in the clearing markets at the time.
 

 The Chair recognizes CHITADARI.

The conversation from Jerry was valid.

I mean in the end the entire robustness of 
the self-certification processes Tran Perrin 
see.

Whether that's transparency between the 
exchanges listing the products or partners or 
the clients that would be indirectly clearing it 
and sharing their transparency with the 
Commission.

I think where the robustness really falls.

There are a number of points have been 
made.

I think Dale touched on that making if 
you're consulting it's the proper ones you're 
consulting.

One of the panelists the challenges 
reaching out to a firm and making sure 
you're getting a consistent view.

Was it clearing arm or the operational 
arm.

I think Ron I think you alluded to the point 
that the broad FCMs and their readiness to 
clear should be a key factor whether the 
product will face a much more smoother 
transition.

I think it's a variety of things.

I don't think we should be limiting this 
activity to just novel products.
 

 We have one more.
 

 From an end user's perspective, if the 
banks does have concerns with the process 
as far as self-certification and practiced they 
have the ability to charge their customers 
additional margins which we see as an end 
user and particular where there are 
particularly products different parts of the 
bank may be competing on a bilateral basis.

To some extent for clearing it to have 
some discussion around the commercial 
aspect.

Where end user are looking for unique 
products to layoff for risks.

Thank you.
 

 Well thank you, Paul for moderating 
today's panels and it's now time foreclosing 
remarks.

We'll start with Commissioner Quintenz.
 

 Thank you Alicia.

Commissioner Benham thank you for 
your leadership for this group.

And Paul.

Thank you all for your feedback.

I learned a lot from each of your 
comments and questions.

To all of the presenters, thank you for the 
work you brought in to bring interesting 
thoughts.

To us to the staff.

You know, I wanted to bring up something 
that commissioner Benham raised in his 
opening comments which is novelty is a 
fleeting concept and I think it goes back to 
novelty is a continuum.

And we're seeing in the market now we're 
seeing digital commodities being created on 
a daily base.

So naivety to some extent is becoming 
somewhat mundane.

While it it be tempting to draw bright lines 
around that I think it's how well this agency 
has been served and how well the markets 
have been served through the principles 
based perspective.

But also all of our staff that work hard on 
a daily basis to insure that market 
participants are following the CEA.

Thank you all for participating today.

Really appreciate it.
 

 Thank you.

Commissioner Benham.
 

 Thanks Alicia.

I want to echo Commissioner Quintenz 
about staff.

They do a fantastic job day in and day 
out.

It's really fantastic work.

Of course for staff on the first two panels 
thank you again for your work and 
contribution.

A lot to be taken away from today.

I appreciate everyone's time and effort.

A lot of self-certification is a big issue and 
one that is headliner of the discussion.

For me personally as I said in my opening 
comments self-certification is over 15 years 
old.

It's worked well and I think it will work well 
in the future.

It serves the CFTC well.

And it promotes innovation which should 
be our number one priority.

We'll continue to support the 
self-certification process.

That said there's always room for 
improvementment I think from both sides the 
participant side clearly when new products 
are launched they are very well established.

I think everyone clearly demonstrated 
processes are in place and people are 
constantly thinking about these.

As I've said this many times the 
incentives with the market participants to put 
out good markets that last and have yew for 
both the members and clearing houses.

From the CFTC side I think that the 
individuals demonstrated what the 
Commission does every day to insure we are 
fulfilling our pontis under the core principles 
but the act and the regulation as well.

I applaud them for all of the work.

I think that the process is very good.

Regardless of this question about novel or 
not, we constantly need to be thinking about 
new products that are coming to market.

As they do come to market.

I personally feel a lot better this afternoon 
Let alone a week or a month ago.

That's because we were able to have this 
open and transparent conversation wapiti to 
cryptos and what's going in the marketplace.

I hope we continue doing this.

And that's said like I said earlier there's 
also room for improvement.

I think these venues serve as an 
opportunity to think about hard questions and 
better solutions in the future.

So with that a quick thanks to Paul 
Archtizel for your time.

Paul was a great moderator and 
gentleman who has a lot of history in this 
building and understands these issues very 
well.

Alicia thank you again for doing a 
fantastic job for the last couple of months.

Thank you to Commissioner Quintenz and 
of course to the Chairman for attend while he 
could.

Finally to this committee as I said earlier 
this will likely be the last meeting of this 
committee.

Alicia will be taking the next steps to issue 
a very broad for the next MRAC.

We welcome your participation or at least 
your interest to participate in the future.

That said we'll be looking at issues 
coming in the years ahead.

I know Commissioner Bowen was very 
proud of the work it did and you all deserve a 
big thanks for your work on that.
 

 Again, thanks to the members of the 
MRAC for a very engaging discussion today.

And thank you to our speakers for great 
presentations.

Okay.

I want to thank everyone for attending the 
first MRAC of 2018 and this meeting is 
adjourned.

 Thank you.

This might have been a question that was 
better placed to CFTC staff in the morning 
but I'll place it to this group.

Anyway, this securities and exchange 
Commission has taken a very different 
approach and perspective from the CFTC in 
terms of its approval or its perspective 
toward Bitcoin products.

It's issued quite a number of warnings.

It will refused to approve what could be 
classed as a Bitcoin derivative products.

I think that the attitude of the Chair 
Clayton of the F.C.C. and differences and 
distinctions and one of those statutory 
differences is that in the Exchange Act there 
is a requirement that the rules of an 
exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent 
manipulative acts and interest.

So there is a general public interest 
provision in there, and the Commission 
interpreted that to say that any, change 
traded product had to have surveillance 
transparency into the underlying trading 
markets.

The trading markets for the underlying 
and had to be regulated.

So I'm wondering if this group feels that 
there is something of value in the public 
interest provision for that sort of general 
public interest provision as regards to 
exchange rules and whether those the 
position of the SCC took in terms of meeting 
having regulated underlying markets was a 
reasonable and positive one.
 

 I think there's a couple of things that 
are different with the SCC in addition to the 
language that you mentioned.

SCC is also -- it's true with the E.T.F. and 
their reasons are shifting slightly on that.

Initially it was no regulated markets and 
now it goes to the point that they want more 
time for price discovery and more time for 
watching the products before.

So they've asked those that have 
submitted the E.T.F. requests until there's 
more time to evaluate.

They have not said they have any 
jurisdiction over Bitcoin or any 
cryptocurrencies.

They've likened Bitcoin and 
cryptocurrencies to money.

And right now they're focused significantly 
on potential fraud in those markets.

So I think that there's a few different 
buckets that the SCC is looking through and 
the prison um is just a very different view 
from the CFTC and the commodities world 
where starting with coin flip in 2015 establish 
that the cryptocurrencies be commodities fit 
the definition of the client Exchange Act.

That would still be the perspective that the 
cryptotokens and cryptocurrencies are 
commodities and how they trade and how 
derivatives products are created off of them 
is a very different process, and I think that -- 
with the core principles that are addressed 
for the futures exchanges and the SEFs is -- 
has extensive protections within that as they 
stand.
 

 I think that as soon as you start 
TRALINGED a futures contract on some 
underlying asset.

No matter how little the underlying asset 
previously had you automatically get a little 
bit of regulation because the problem of 
manipulation that might occur in the futures 
contract when it does occur it's probably 
occurring in the underlying and the CFTC is 
starting inquiring about the underlying and 
collecting information and impose various 
legal obligations on the exchanges to go 
along with the KCHCK's learning process.

So part of undoing the novelty of a novel 
situation is the CFTC's learning.

But part of that learning is effectively 
regulation coming into a market that did not 
used to be regulated.

So I think that the big question is whether 
the right way to do it to be so cautious 
getting it you wait a long time and don't start 
anything you totally understand it.

Or you allow then so what.

Maybe they stay on a very small-scale.

I know I've brought up these past 
examples.

I believe that the first interest rates was 
the Ginnie Mae contract.

I believe it was a totally flawed contract.

The idea of futures on mortgage backed 
securities was a fabulously good idea.

But the contract itself was terrible.

It was firths approved.

It firths traded for a number of years.

Eventually the flaws became apparent 
and there was a migration out of one and 
into another one.

And eventually treasury note contracts 
have become for determining interest rates 
in the U.S.

It started out with a process that might 
say approved some novel contracts that 
didn't work very well maybe because they 
didn't think would enough.

I think that the end result was quite good.

On the other side of the coin which goes 
to the Marcus's is single stock future.

I think single stock futures are a great 
idea.

It was a great idea in the 1970s when they 
were proposed.

The answer not very much happened.

And the reason not very much happened 
is that the SCC didn't want to do anything 
unless it was perfect.

And nothing is perfect so nothing got 
done.

So something probably in between is a 
good idea.

Whether some thought that goes into the 
process of designing the futures contract.

But it's a learning process that you're 
getting into is the right way to think about it.
 

 We're going to take one more 
question.

And Chair recognizes Kathleen Cronin.
 

 Thank you.

So there's been a lot of discussion about 
novel and complex, and I think what's 
important to reiterate from our perspective is 
that asset the underlying asset class is new 
but our product is very much in line we've 
done on the indices.

A number of the factors that Mr. Pla 
volatility doesn't make something novel and 
it feeds into something to be managed.

Bitcoin futures has our index has a year 
has a much longer price history than that.

And in terms of impact on the risk pool.

We trade and clear products that are 
volatile and that create certain risks outside 
of the Bitcoin.

I think Julie mentioned the emerging 
currencies and we do manage it doesn't 
present a unique risk to the mutualized risk 
pool.

We did have meetings during this process 
and you're not going to reach consensus 
what is a good product to bring to market or 
not to bring to the market.

Ultimately it's up to the exchange to make 
sure they're in the compliance with the core 
principles.

And frankly if no one chooses to clear the 
products it's not going to be successful so it's 
not in our best interest to bring forward.
 

 So I think we've had a pretty 
productive day.

And very good conversation.

To wrap-up I'll pose two questions 
everybody will have an opportunity to 
answer.

The questions are one, what's an optimal 
process for SRO process for new products 
and pif Klee novel products and number two 
what's an optimal process for CFTC 
oversight for new products both pre-and post 
launch.
 

 I'm happy to start.

I think I'll reiterate what I said earlier.

I think certain the FIA that the 
self-certification process is valuable.

It's valuable to our markets and it has a 
history of encouraging innovation.

Yet I think that the comments made by 
Chairman Giancarlo a couplely at the ABA 
conference let's reflect on what we've 
learned.

Is there something about this particular 
product and set of circumstances that wasn't 
envisioned and is there an adjustments we 
need to make.

I think that recommendations he DCMs 
and SEFs should be disclose and 
accommodate input from concerned parties 
and make that available so people 
understand how those comments and that 
feedback is incorporated in the product 
launch.

I think that's taking a very good and 
valuable set of regulations and making them 
more fit for purpose as we continue to find 
new product types that are valid for listing.
 

 The Chair recognizes Marney 
Rosenberg.
 

 Why has there been so much 
controversy over this launch.

If the exchanges and the clearing houses 
that were on the panel sought input.

Clearly I think there is a need for a 
member consultation process that happens 
on the front end which I can say didn't 
universally happen in this case.

Given that the members do provide a 
significant amount of financial resources 
there is a vested interest from the clearing 
community to be engaged and provide input.

We as J.P. Morgan invest a lot time on 
models and we do spend a lot of time giving 
that information back to clearing houses.

We do hope that is considered going 
forward.
 

 The Chair recognizes Dale Michaels.
 

 You know, I think there were the 
recommendation as far as having DCMs 
approved there's been some type of reach 
out is a valid path.

One that certainly we want to see happen 
at least from the clearinghouse perspective.

We do have venues to reach out to our 
current firms but the side constituents as well 
that's important to us.

As I said I was a little surprised at the 
disconnect, and I think that's a lesson to 
learn.

Make sure that the right folks from each 
of the firms are on the panel so that that 
feedback is getting back to the proper folks 
at each of the firms because these are 
important feedback forum.

We do take this feedback seriously and 
this feedback goes to our risk management.

We want to know what concerns out there 
purely from a risk management perspective.

We certainly don't want to get in the 
competitive issue.

We think that the self-certification process 
has a great deal of innovation in this industry 
from you see that the products that have 
been launched because of the CFTC 
oversight has been tremendous.

You talk about Ginnie Mae CRI.

The energy futures and everything else.

We want to continue that path but we 
need to make sure that the risk management 
considerations which we are very important 
to us, very important to our clearing member 
firms, and biside firms and want to make 
sure that continues to happen as well.

That's why I stopped playing the lottery.  I read about some poor bastard who played the same numbers every week.  The one week he didn't play, it hit, and he would have won millions.

He hung himself the next day.

Udatron,"HANDELSBLATT article / Google translation from German:

The car will soon have its own account

In future, cars will not only drive on their own, but will also pay for the fuel bill and parking fees. The Internet of Things makes it possible. Crucial here: A further development of the blockchain technique.

31.01.2018 - 14:44

In just a few years, vehicles will move effortlessly through the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting people, cars, homes and cities to each other. Already today, customers in selected regions can communicate with their vehicles via voice assistants such as Google Assistant or Amazon Echo. In the future certain functions of the Smarthome will be automatically controlled by the vehicle, for example, the vehicle could pass on the arrival time, so that the heater starts at the right time and the house or apartment heats energy-saving. If you want, you can even check what is still in the fridge at home. In short, we are getting closer to our goal of turning the vehicle into a digital, mobile companion that actively supports us based on our habits.

To shape this future of mobility, automakers are increasingly pushing software solutions to data analytics, artificial intelligence, connectivity and the Internet of Things. They work on the intelligent networking and data-based optimization of devices, machines, sensors, drones, smartphones, vehicles and related services. Because with the increasing networking also the independent communication between machines among each other (""Machine-to-Machine"" or M2M for short) is increasingly becoming the focus of mobility development. By 2020, according to forecasts, nearly 50 billion things will be networked on the Internet.

By analyzing data and communicating with one another, devices, machines and vehicles will not only be able to exchange information in the future, but will also be able to independently conduct trustworthy transactions, such as online payments, to make our everyday lives easier. An autonomously driving electric car, equipped with a digital wallet, a so-called e-wallet, could then autonomously control the cheapest charging station and independently pay for the electricity. Put simply, this means: one machine transfers money to another machine. For this to work smoothly, it needs a unified and tamper-proof network and encryption technology. The technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Iota plays a key role: the Blockchain.

In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmobility, Iota could become a central digital currency. This digital form of payment is based on an advancement of blockchain technology, called tangle, which has many advantages. This solution is so interesting because it is fast and secure, it does not incur transaction costs, and in addition, infinite many operations can take place simultaneously. The bitcoin or the blockchain is different: The more transactions are made, the longer the data chain - and the slower the system. Also Bitcoin transactions were very expensive because of the high demand and the energy costs of the computers last and cost temporarily over 40 dollar.

In Iota or Tangle, on the other hand, the transactions are processed in parallel, not sequentially in blocks, and that only a few computers. And the more transactions take place, the bigger, safer and faster the system becomes. The encryption of a Tangle-based system could even withstand hacker attacks that are performed on supercomputers with quantum technology and which currently employ the Bitcoin community. With that in mind, many experts are currently coming to the conclusion that blockchain technology is too inefficient for the Internet of Things, and that Tangle may prevail in the machine economy of the future. I also see great potential here in view of the many billions of transactions that will occur every day. For example, in this exciting new world of mobility, Iota self-driving vehicles could bill for travel payments, pay parking garage fees, pay for fuel and utility bills, tolls, or garage visits. Autonomous vehicles could thus act like independent entrepreneurs and even independently determine and settle the optimal price per trip depending on supply and demand.

Johann Jungwirth is an engineer and, as Chief Digital Officer at Volkswagen, responsible for the digital transformation and development of self-driving vehicles within the Group. Previously he worked for Daimler and Apple.",dtje4au,2,1/31/2018 15:07,,,,,,

suninabox,"&gt;If they had their most rapid expansion, more Tether being produced than ever before (I'm not sure if they did, just saying if that's true)

It is true:

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/

&gt;and the price WAS NOT affected doesn't that prove that it's other market forces at work on the price and it isn't Tether that can make things go up or down whenever they want?

Either that or there was going to be a much larger crash that was only partially averted by injecting .85 billion into the market.

Let's say that .85 billion isn't backed by anything, what would the market have looked like if .85 billion wasn't injected during january?

It's not that it didn't affect the price, how could .85 billion not affect the market, especially as trade volumes dropped significantly? It's that it didn't cause the price to skyrocket, which shows the underlying demand is low enough that even when someone is putting half a billion dollars in a space of a week it wasn't enough to get prices to rise.

If you're saying .85 billion being injected in a month can't shift the markets and it would have been the same without that money, how much money do you think it takes to move the market?

I've heard an argument that the reason why so many Tethers were printed was because during the price drop, lots of people wanted to move out from Bitcoin, which is why there was such an increase in Tether even when every other coin was tanking. Even if we park the reservations about how Tether is getting money to print Tether without banking, I'm not sure this idea holds up. People have lost confidence in ALL crypto, besides one that is designed to never be worth more than a dollar, that has never been audited? Why would you have more confidence in Tether than USD? 

We've gone from there being a market for 10 million tether to 2.2 billion tether in a year, despite that being the year that they lost US and Taiwanese banking, despite the fact that there has been no skyrocketing in the amount of bitcoin being traded to somehow explain demand. In fact the largest increase in Tether has happened since bitcoin trading volumes started dropping dramatically.",dtje40i,2,1/31/2018 15:07,,,,,,

**Author**:  _s1lentparr0t_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;...and realized that Satoshi was speaking about BCH. Now I'm very sad that I betrayed the real Bitcoin BCH. I'm sorry guys - it took me very long to see what was obvious.
Blockstream is a trojan horse. They killed the freedom feature in Bitcoin by blocking the block size increase. They fooled all the community - that's so sad.

&gt;Satoshi never thought that increasing the block size is a problem:


&gt;if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
   maxblocksize = largerlimit

&gt;It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that &gt; block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it &gt; are already obsolete.

&gt;When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old  &gt; versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;And here's why Bitcoin should increase block size whenever it's needed:


&gt;By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay  &gt;ahead of the number of transactions.

Raiblocks/Nano has the potential to be big but that not may come to fruition. If it is to be a world currency, then it will have to have a fiat gateway to allow shops cash it to fiat immediately.  This is the next step for Raiblocks/Nano. 

Also your point about it being centralised is a bit off.  The major problem with centralisation is inflation/deflation so when some holds the power to increase or decrease supply to affect price to suit them (like any fiat currency and ripple).

The car will soon have its own account

In future, cars will not only drive on their own, but will also pay for the fuel bill and parking fees. The Internet of Things makes it possible. Crucial here: A further development of the blockchain technique.

31.01.2018 - 14:44

In just a few years, vehicles will move effortlessly through the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting people, cars, homes and cities to each other. Already today, customers in selected regions can communicate with their vehicles via voice assistants such as Google Assistant or Amazon Echo. In the future certain functions of the Smarthome will be automatically controlled by the vehicle, for example, the vehicle could pass on the arrival time, so that the heater starts at the right time and the house or apartment heats energy-saving. If you want, you can even check what is still in the fridge at home. In short, we are getting closer to our goal of turning the vehicle into a digital, mobile companion that actively supports us based on our habits.

To shape this future of mobility, automakers are increasingly pushing software solutions to data analytics, artificial intelligence, connectivity and the Internet of Things. They work on the intelligent networking and data-based optimization of devices, machines, sensors, drones, smartphones, vehicles and related services. Because with the increasing networking also the independent communication between machines among each other (""Machine-to-Machine"" or M2M for short) is increasingly becoming the focus of mobility development. By 2020, according to forecasts, nearly 50 billion things will be networked on the Internet.

By analyzing data and communicating with one another, devices, machines and vehicles will not only be able to exchange information in the future, but will also be able to independently conduct trustworthy transactions, such as online payments, to make our everyday lives easier. An autonomously driving electric car, equipped with a digital wallet, a so-called e-wallet, could then autonomously control the cheapest charging station and independently pay for the electricity. Put simply, this means: one machine transfers money to another machine. For this to work smoothly, it needs a unified and tamper-proof network and encryption technology. The technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Iota plays a key role: the Blockchain.
In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmobility, Iota could become a central digital currency. This digital form of payment is based on an advancement of blockchain technology, called tangle, which has many advantages. This solution is so interesting because it is fast and secure, it does not incur transaction costs, and in addition, infinite many operations can take place simultaneously. The bitcoin or the blockchain is different: The more transactions are made, the longer the data chain - and the slower the system. Also Bitcoin transactions were very expensive because of the high demand and the energy costs of the computers last and cost temporarily over 40 dollar.

In Iota or Tangle, on the other hand, the transactions are processed in parallel, not sequentially in blocks, and that only a few computers. And the more transactions take place, the bigger, safer and faster the system becomes. The encryption of a Tangle-based system could even withstand hacker attacks that are performed on supercomputers with quantum technology and which currently employ the Bitcoin community. With that in mind, many experts are currently coming to the conclusion that blockchain technology is too inefficient for the Internet of Things, and that Tangle may prevail in the machine economy of the future. I also see great potential here in view of the many billions of transactions that will occur every day. For example, in this exciting new world of mobility, Iota self-driving vehicles could bill for travel payments, pay parking garage fees, pay for fuel and utility bills, tolls, or garage visits. Autonomous vehicles could thus act like independent entrepreneurs and even independently determine and settle the optimal price per trip depending on supply and demand.

trica,For example the discussion would be how does bitcoin work technically.

Technical details I would forget anyway unless I choose to learn them but I would prefer to do so with reading about it because the information will be more accurate and I can consume it at my own pace. Another more mundane topic would be a lengthy comparison of different mobile phones or internet providers. That is something I would look up online when needed - why waste time talking about it.

LovelyDay,"&gt; From my understanding you only have to run a full node if you want to validate others transactions. This means that it will be easy for users to make transactions without strong hardware. This effectively means that they contribute nothing to the network's strength/security/decentralization while still using the network. They basically provide nothing but cost something.

I agree on this.

&gt; BUT, I don't think that it really matters. I think that Metcalfe's law plays a large role here. I can't imagine a food truck paying for an ASIC rig and all the power required to run it, and I want to be able to use bitcoin at a food truck, so it's worth it to me to try to provide something for them. I don't mine, so my ""something provided"" is fees.

Instead of network fees (which benefit miners and directly protect the security of the currency) you would be paying a fee (included in the price of your hot dog) for the vendor to protect himself against the risk of doublespend.

There are already service providers on BTC that provide this, they charge something to protect against fraud.

End result: network fees stay low, only those who need a specialised service pay for it, the rest of us don't.

&gt;  I don't mind if my fees increase a little bit due to demand (obviously I'm talking about small fees, nothing like what BTC has right now, but a few cents wouldn't bother me). I want more people to be able to participate, and if lightning will bring fees under control, allow anybody to use bitcoin quickly and easily that will be good for me and everybody else. There's no point to me having bitcoin if I can only spend it a couple places, and I can only spend it a couple places if it doesn't get easier/cheaper to use.

Totally agree!

&gt; And this extra overhead of users shouldn't matter to the proposed fees. We're talking about a few satoshi here. If we double that, quadruple that, whatever, I really don't give a fuck. Sure it costs ""more"" but it's worth it for the added utility.

The double/quadruple you don't give a fuck about can amount to some money for others who are in tighter circumstances. For businesses making lots of transactions that also sums up to higher operating costs very quickly.

Right now we can still aim for &lt; 1 US cent fee and we can have new innovative services like Yours.org and other services like video/music streaming etc. which have volume of customers and content creators could make money than traditional channels even if price of product is very low.

So I think we don't disagree for the most part. I just think that higher network fees are not necessary / not the way to go for benefitting the security in terms of point of sale.",dtjdm6v,2,1/31/2018 14:59,,,,,,

Even if government steps in, it doesn't mean the end of decentralization.

banished98ti,"Except nothing he says explains anything.

Bubbles in financial markets reflect a demoralized population at whole. If you encourage people to act on their appetites you get a complete lack of reason. The 60's sexual revolution was followed by the 70's financial revolution where regulations concerning usury were dismantled nation wide. The 2 are related. The financial powers that be therefore promote an Dionysian economy. After the drunkeness begins to wear off, the victims look around them and see nothing but horror and misery. That is somewhat the phase we are in today. 


If you look at bitcoin, it was pretty much a *dead* project until the libertarians came in promoting addictions as freedom. Vice is freedom according to the libertarians, so go ahead and buy all the drugs you want but pay me 20k a btc for the privilege to exercise that so called freedom. 

Soros has done everything he can to keep the populace demoralized because it is the defacto source of his power. Without a usurious financial system, Soros is nothing. Usury allows soros to perform 'financial alchemy' as he correctly describes his book.",dtjct3d,2,1/31/2018 14:47,,,,,,

skelly890,"&gt; Fucking cryptominers.

The good news is bitcoin is going down the tubes.

The bad news is ethereum (which is mined with nvidia cards afaik) probably isn't going to follow it.  Far.

The good news is that the profit margins are stupidly low (I've tried*) so it won't take much of a shift to make mining uneconomic.

jedi_lion-o,"Several years ago I was watching my brother play Endless Legend on his laptop. The performance was abysmal, so for Christmas I used some leftover parts and new parts to build him a modest gaming PC. 

His long-time girlfriend (basically his wife), also loves Endless Legend. Recently while talking to her about Endless Space 2, she expressed jealously because her 8 year old laptop could no longer even run Endless Legend, so Endless Space 2 was out of the question. It broke my heart a little bit. I would love to build her a new machine, but funds are low, and graphics card prices are stupid high. Also, unlike before, I don't have any spare parts lying around. A graphics card would be a huge boost!

Also - the cryto mining doesn't make any sense to me. A friend of mine asked if I could do some research a while back to see if it was ""worth it"" to mine. Running the numbers I can't think of any case, other than free electricity, where it makes any sense. If you are banking on the currency increasing in price to make a profit, you should just invest in the coin outright. Not so sure about other hashing algorithms, but if other cryptos go the way of bitcoin the ASIC chips will blow CPUs out of the water - leaving us with a bunch of half burnt out second hand cards and a bloated market.

You have heard about bitcoin in the news, but do you know how it could benefit you? Bitcoin strives to revolutionize currency as we know it. Bitcoin gives you the freedom to take your digital money out of the banking system and store it on computer memory that YOU CONTROL - similar to keeping your cash under the mattress, but it's in secure computer memory.

nootropicat,"&gt;This is not true. Bitcoin is a simpler scripting language, and so it is easier to do formal verification on it. 

EVM is turing complete which means you can implement on it or compile to it any language you want. 

&gt;As for proof of stake, if it works, it's going to work in Lightning.

No. Lightning makes an assumption that penalty transactions are included in blocks. Which means miners can't censor transactions. So LN assumes not only a working proof of work chain, but a *variant* of it. Therefore, it can't be equivalent to any pure proof of stake system, even without going into more details.

&gt;The total stacked work in ethereum is much less than in bitcoin, making it more vulnerable to existing data centers.

Doesn't matter, any attack that rewinds a day would destroy the network just as effectively as a weird attack that would rewrite the entire chain. 

&gt;Furthermore, bitcoin did not have a premine.

Is that really an advantage? Somebody has to do work on the base protocol. Lack of initial stake creates a free riding problem: everyone needs developers' work, but individually, your best bet is to do something else and buy/mine tokens with money earned. Developers improving the network/clients itself aren't paid anything so they can't even buy the coin that rises (presumably) because of their own work.  

This results in developers with peculiar incentives, not necessarily aligned with the apparent goals of the project. LukeJr afaik got into bitcoin only because he saw it as a way to make people use the [tonal number system](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tonal_Bitcoin) instead of decimal.

10 years to Quantum PCs that play minecraft is insanely optimistic.  I think you meant 10 years before QPC can calculate 2+2.  First research I read on QPC was 15 years ago, and they were claiming full penetration in 10 years.

&gt; and that will make bitcoin very vulnerable to brute forcing keys and stealing coins easily.

ECDSA and SHA256 are not really good applications of QPC.  They are iterative and each state depends on a previous discrete state.  The exact opposite of QPC.

It does matter what the tech is if it has economic characteristics that look like Bitcoin in the design. 

&gt;What we are after are valuations of a coin that aren‚Äôt negatively or positively influenced by the price of another coin.

Then you have to make it act differently. The fact of ETH being used in a bunch of different ways does not change the fat that it is supply inelastic in its enumeration. 

&gt;Right now we are nowhere close to that because almost every crypto is tied almost solely to btc

Moreso, that they share key design charactaristics. Of which Bitcoin is the standard bearer as first-mover. 

&gt;There is no way to arbitrage out its value when btc goes up or down

There are loads of ways that are simply underutilized. But it is the fact of having cryptocurrencies grouped together in centralized exchanges that cause them all to go up when fiat comes in, and all to go down when fiat goes out.

Real_LinusTorvalds,"No, Richard, it's 'Bitcoin', not 'GNU/Bitcoin'. The most important contributions that the FSF made to Bitcoin were the creation of the GPL and the GCC compiler. Those are fine and inspired products. GCC is a monumental achievement and has earned you, RMS, and the Free Software Foundation countless kudos and much appreciation.

Following are some reasons for you to mull over, including some already answered in your FAQ.

One guy, Linus Torvalds, used GCC to make his operating system (yes, Bitcoin is an OS -- more on this later). He named it 'Bitcoin' with a little help from his friends. Why doesn't he call it GNU/Bitcoin? Because he wrote it, with more help from his friends, not you. You named your stuff, I named my stuff -- including the software I wrote using GCC -- and Linus named his stuff. The proper name is Bitcoin because Linus Torvalds says so. Linus has spoken. Accept his authority. To do otherwise is to become a nag. You don't want to be known as a nag, do you?

(An operating system) != (a distribution). Bitcoin is an operating system. By my definition, an operating system is that software which provides and limits access to hardware resources on a computer. That definition applies whereever you see Bitcoin in use. However, Bitcoin is usually distributed with a collection of utilities and applications to make it easily configurable as a desktop system, a server, a development box, or a graphics workstation, or whatever the user needs. In such a configuration, we have a Bitcoin (based) distribution. Therein lies your strongest argument for the unwieldy title 'GNU/Bitcoin' (when said bundled software is largely from the FSF). Go bug the distribution makers on that one. Take your beef to Red Hat, Mandrake, and Slackware. At least there you have an argument. Bitcoin alone is an operating system that can be used in various applications without any GNU software whatsoever. Embedded applications come to mind as an obvious example.

Next, even if we limit the GNU/Bitcoin title to the GNU-based Bitcoin distributions, we run into another obvious problem. XFree86 may well be more important to a particular Bitcoin installation than the sum of all the GNU contributions. More properly, shouldn't the distribution be called XFree86/Bitcoin? Or, at a minimum, XFree86/GNU/Bitcoin? Of course, it would be rather arbitrary to draw the line there when many other fine contributions go unlisted. Yes, I know you've heard this one before. Get used to it. You'll keep hearing it until you can cleanly counter it.

You seem to like the lines-of-code metric. There are many lines of GNU code in a typical Bitcoin distribution. You seem to suggest that (more LOC) == (more important). However, I submit to you that raw LOC numbers do not directly correlate with importance. I would suggest that clock cycles spent on code is a better metric. For example, if my system spends 90% of its time executing XFree86 code, XFree86 is probably the single most important collection of code on my system. Even if I loaded ten times as many lines of useless bloatware on my system and I never excuted that bloatware, it certainly isn't more important code than XFree86. Obviously, this metric isn't perfect either, but LOC really, really sucks. Please refrain from using it ever again in supporting any argument.

Last, I'd like to point out that we Bitcoin and GNU users shouldn't be fighting among ourselves over naming other people's software. But what the heck, I'm in a bad mood now. I think I'm feeling sufficiently obnoxious to make the point that GCC is so very famous and, yes, so very useful only because Bitcoin was developed. In a show of proper respect and gratitude, shouldn't you and everyone refer to GCC as 'the Bitcoin compiler'? Or at least, 'Bitcoin GCC'? Seriously, where would your masterpiece be without Bitcoin? Languishing with the HURD?

If there is a moral buried in this rant, maybe it is this:

Be grateful for your abilities and your incredible success and your considerable fame. Continue to use that success and fame for good, not evil. Also, be especially grateful for Bitcoin' huge contribution to that success. You, RMS, the Free Software Foundation, and GNU software have reached their current high profiles largely on the back of Bitcoin. You have changed the world. Now, go forth and don't be a nag.

Thanks for listening.

ep7i0CtZek,"Thank you for the detailed explanation. It has affected my point of view somewhat. :)

I understand I can choose whatever software + network I prefer. But there's plenty of reasons why it would be preferable to upgrade BTC as opposed to have all these forks. No brand confusion. Keeping the community united. Easy adoption for merchants. In the end the goal is to have a global digital currency. There will most likely be only 1 or 2. 

I'm not convinced that the current state of bitcoin is caused through active consensus. Perhaps the consensus model is crippled and preventing bitcoin to move forward. 

The network can provide consensus. But there needs to be a driving force for innovation. I think the only ones who can do that are the software developers like Bitcoin Core. They need to push and facilitate the changes. 

I'm sure it wont be easy to get +50% percent consensus for any update that requires a hardfork. Most likely: The bigger the update - the bigger the change - the more pushback you'll get. People don't like change. That's also why so many people still use old Windows and Android versions. If it ain't broke indeed. 

I think it's not ideal that the mechanism to provide consensus is through installing a certain software program. Most people don't pick a client because that's how they want to ""vote"". That's not the purpose of doing a software release. Maybe they just prefer the user interface colors. Many people might be unintentionally maintaining the status quo. 

I think it would be better to have the consensus model built into the bitcoin ""protocol"" somehow. For example. A nice update would be a simple ""consensus provider"" system like:

* [v] ""Vote + enable feature X for next 1000th block when consensus &gt; 60%""
* [ ] ""Vote + enable feature Y for next 1000th block when consensus &gt; 60%""

Each node/miner then broadcasts its user agent including some flags that represent the ""vote + enabled"" features. Similar to how browsers do it:

* Satoshi:0.15.1 [feature_X_voted] [feature_Z_enabled]

If you are okay with some feature you enable it. But as long as nobody else does, it remains deactivated on your client. Only once the majority of people have the option enabled will the feature be activated on all the nodes that had it set to enable. A coordinated hardfork occurs at the next predefined ""hardfork slot block"" with &gt; 60% consensus.

NickAdOps,"I really love Wagerr idea but once the team start to kick people for criticize that means something really bad is going on.

The entire idea of Decentralized is not just the currency or the use case but the people, the community.

Stalin would take down people who criticize him and created a Centeralized society, we can see how it ended up.

Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cardano, Status and pretty much any legit Decentralized project will face and accept inside criticism or even from the outside.

Once the team are unable to conform that, means they are no longer part of the Decentralized Movement.

No matter how idiots are FUDing or Fomoing, team should stay egnostic.

The community would take down any FUD if needed, that's not the job of the team, it's the job of Stalin and dictatorships to do that.

britcruise,"yeah...I like that. I'd even argue ""decentralized"" is too techie at first. 

Bitcoin is a new, global currency that is not issued by any governments or controlled by any bank. It also does for money what email did for the postal system.

-
The e-mail point is interesting because it's one of those cases where you get to leapfrog on existing intuition. In terms of 'paper to digital' message leap. But I've found it doesn't work too well. The problem is that digital money already exists...and so people don't find it all that special that money is electronic. You can kinda skip that step that ""money is digital""

Instead jump to: 

it's a digital money that ""you can hold/control on your own computer and send to other computers directly"" instead of the digital money we have today that lives ""in private computer memory at the bank"" and you ""have to ask permission"" to send around.

Which is why I'm starting to think I could open with:

bitcoin is based on digital things that can't be copied. 
(like ""little files"")
And they can only be sent from one computer's memory to another. 

That allows us to send these little files around directly, without any 3rd party control (bank)

and heck, we can create these digital things instead of the government.

and finally, we can CHOOSE to value them if we want.

Purpleflower88,"## **Erotic stories brought to life | Adult VideoBooks | KiK for later+**

I started out calling these ""Kik for later+"", because they share some similarities, but ""Adult VideoBooks"" or ""Erotic stories brought to life"" serves it better. They are created by using a sexy written erotic story combined with pictures and videos of me living the life of Emma. It is quite unique and different from a normal kik session. These VideoBooks are the result of a joined effort between Sienna Rose, a friend/erotica writer, and myself ('actress' of the movies and pictures)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **But what is it?**

* A personalised *(using your first name)* erotic story (written), featuring myself (Emma), you and sometimes some other characters, combined with pictures and videos that match the story, bringing it to life

* The text and pictures will be delivered in an order so that you can read a bit of text, look at a matching picture, read a bit more, look at a matching video, etc. You will be able to re-use the VideoBook at a later time to enjoy it again as often as you like.

* But since this is quite a new concept, **[here's a preview!](http://0djmfskjfdqsmldjflmsjdf.blogspot.be/2017/12/emma-smiled-happily-as-she-closed.html)** If you like what you read and see here, you're gonna love the stories!

&amp;nbsp;

## **Current stories**

#### **1. Emma's escort agency experience [$25]**

* Emma has been divorced for 9 months after being married for 10+ years and never experienced an orgasm. A friend convinces her to use an escort agency to change that. The things she experiences, she never thought possible...

* ~ 30 mins worth of content; 7 pics &amp; 11 vids (~ 3 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **2. Emma gets mind controlled and turned into a sex slave [$28]**

* Emma realizes the world has a lot to show her that she has never opened herself up to see. She needs this to change, and (wrongfully?) trusts the first person offering to show her a whole new world. She gets strung along, mind controlled and eventually turned into a sex slave...

* ~ 30 mins worth of content; 6 pics &amp; 12 vids (~ 7 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **3. Emma's husband finally returns home from prison [$30]**

* Emma's husband is released from prison after being wrongfully convicted. She is ready for him, waiting at home, with just an apron and heels on ... But is he ready for her? 

* ~ 45 mins worth of content; 5 pics &amp; 13 vids (~ 11 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **4. Emma marries rich, but wealth isn't everything... [$28]**

* Emma marries a rich entrepreneur, but it turns out money isn't everything. Her husband can't give her what she needs, but his son can give her something she needs badly, but should they...? Can they resist the urge? Oh stepmom, we shouldn't do this!

* ~ 30 mins worth of content; 5 pics &amp; 13 vids (~ 7 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **5. Emma gone BAD! üî•NEWüî• [$35]**

* Emma used to be a good girl, but this all changes in a very short trip with her friend ""Lusty Lorna"". Naked sunbathing, her first blowjob, her first anal, ... she ends up cheating on her husband twice... And... He's happy about it!  The things she learned...

* ~ 60 mins worth of content; 9 pics &amp; 21 vids (~ 18 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **Your own custom theme**

Would you prefer a custom VideoBook based exactly on your request? That's also possible. Please keep in mind it kan take upto 2 weeks to create. The price varies, but is around $50 - $75

&amp;nbsp;

**Bundle Deals:** Get 20% off if you buy 2 stories and 30% if you buy 3

&amp;nbsp;

## **Rather have me rate your cock or cumshot??**

I recently started doing cock &amp; cumshot ratings as well, due to popular demand of the way I write. Want me to let you know what I think about your cock? What I would or wouldn't do with it? Do you think you're big enough for me? **$15** for a lengthy written cock or cumshot rating!

7a11l409b1d3c65,"&gt;Agora Reloaded has been hacked. :(
They changed the code by making all the withdrawals go to an address specified by the hacker, 
half of bitcoins were stolen, we tried to continue restoring the money and the missing withdraws, 
but two days ago,  the same thing happened again, finally, the IP was discovered by two different hackers, 
we made an agreement with one of them, but after pay the other one, he scammed us and told us that 
he does not want an agreement and threat with publishing the IP if we don't close the site claiming ''there is only
one real Agora''. Agora had too many enemies because of the name after all.

&gt;Sadly we know the bug which allowed them to discover the IP and the other bug to get access to the 
bitcoin server. It is a mistake we won't forget as they broke an amazing project. We are all sad here.

&gt;After days considering, damn, the best of all of us is to burn the servers in a forest.

&gt;Sorry.

To their defense, not only did they find the bugs, but they are also very transparent about the whole situation. Others might have just gone offline without giving any notice at all. But they didn't, and provided detailed and honest information, which should be appreciated.

By utilizing cryptography and math, bitcoin takes your money out of a centralized banking system, and instead gives you full control of it - similar to keeping your cash under the mattress, but in a much more convenient way. 

Bitcoin cuts down on the cost of using your money. No more expensive transfer or account fees. It also removes a central power from deciding what you can and can't spend your money on. The open design of bitcoin allows you to verify money that is sent to you - no one can lie about a transaction!

suninabox,"&gt; The velocity of BTC is obviously smaller than USD. But so what?

So if the dollar equivalent in BTC facilitates less wealth generation than the same amount of currency in dollars (due to the volatility and incentives to hoard instead of spend), then its not generating any extra wealth, in fact its causing less wealth to be generated because its encouraging rent-seeking over actual wealth generation.

People who otherwise would have put their money into wealth generating investments are instead just sitting on thousands of dollars of bitcoin and not using them to facilitate any trade because they're just waiting for the price to go up.

Opportunity cost matters, and an irrational market that rewards a small number of people at the expense of wider economic productivity is not a good thing.

How has more wealth been generated by putting billions into bitcoin instead of putting billions into lithium battery factories or electric car companies?

Bitcoins cost thousands of dollars of electricity to produce, and if they're worse for wealth generation than fiat then they're only profiting individuals at the expense of the wider economy via perverse economic incentives.",dtjbjou,2,1/31/2018 14:28,,,,,,

MoonNoon,"Wow it is holding its price well. I didn't even realize it hit a ratio of 0.02! Eth does have a stronger, united community while bitcoin is stagnant and BCH is new.

I might be stupid for sticking with bitcoin (cash) but I just have a soft spot for it.

Objectively, ethereum is centralized in its development. If Vitalik goes rogue or something happens to him, eth will take a huge hit. Also, its big changes like the fork because of a hack or changing from PoW to PoS is increased risk, though it can have a high pay off in the long run.

As a speculative investment, I think it's good but it's not trying to be a solid asset vehicle like BCH/BTC is. I would say to split up your assets to your ratio of belief in the coin.

I feel you, but it takes time. The bear market, if we are in one, is when the believers have to take action to promote it. I'm trying to get a meetup going and going to try and get merchants to accept it locally once bitpay enables it.

So I think a few questions arise at this 
point.



One is the current process, the 
self-certification process, appropriate for new 
and novel contracts?

 
As I said I think that how products 
currently come to market for all products 
unless it is a simple month addition, goes 
through a process even with the 
self-certification.



It favids meeting with members.



It involves meetings with participants and 
involves meetings with staff.



There is a process in place.



I think that most people are comfortable 
with that process.



But that's not to say there can't be 
improvements to the process.

 

I'd say almost it's a function of the 
concept of novelty.



I don't think novelty is binary and I think 
it's a continuum.



The question implicitly as the novel 
complex end of the spectrum.



Maybe the answer should there be more 
regulatory engagement.



Should there be a circuit breaker to insure 
the views and the considerations brought by 
a variety of stakeholders.



Clearing members, and users are taken 
into account in risk management.

 

I think that leads to the next question 
is how do you define what's nail or complex.



Or what's nail.



Where along the continuum does the 
more in-depth process kick in?



I think in retrospect looking at Bitcoin 
everyone can agree that's a novel 
instrument.



Which should be subject to additional or 
heightened review.

 

I think there are a few factors to 
consider.



So if a few that the product has limited 
industry.



Even though we're going to do a lot of 
analysis the history of maybe historical 
prices are volatile and/or there are price 
discontinue tease.



If you have volatility and gap moves 
maybe that's an indication of poor liquidity.



The price history could be volatile and the 
price is continuous. Suggesting the lack of the liquidity.



Maybe the product is one that has the 
potential to introduce potential to the 
clearinghouse member community.



Most products start slow and grow.



If it has the materially that the mutualized 
pool.

 
I know there might be settlement 
issues.



And is the product appeal to a niche client 
segment.



If that's true does that mean there's going 
to be a very subset of clearers able to and 
willing to clear the product.



How might that might affect.



I don't think that's an exhaustive list.



I think those are probably factors to 
consider.

 
 I agree.



I think it's primarily important that it not be 
because it's a volatile products.



A lot of the products are volatile.



And that's why there are futures contracts 
on these products.



To look at the default risks or it operates 
differently and it would be a unique bucket.



I think that's something that would be 
worth consideration.

 
 I think from a CFTC's perspective 
something important to think about is 
whether the staff of the CFTC would have 
the capability to sort out some kind of mess 
or scandal that wound up being dumped Bo 
the laps of the CFTC as a result of 
something going wrong with a new product.



If it's something like a different agricultural 
product or a different metal.



Something that the CFTC is used to 
dealing with it may not be novel.



If it's something like a cryptocurrency and 
the CFTC were asked to sort out 
bankruptcies or financial disaster that 
occurred by doing some forensic research.



Would there be any expertise in the 
organization to do it.



So it would be novel from an exchange's 
perspective if the exchange did not have the 
ability to work its way through problems that 
might occur in its own contracts because of 
lack of familiarity and lack of expertise.



I want to take a little bit of issue with 
something that was said earlier.



This is the idea of running a new financial 
products by let's say the existing people in 
industry who might be affected by those 
products.



I think that had happened in the 1970s we 
would not ever gotten financial fop.



I think it kind of got it anyway, and it was a 
good idea that came around in the 1970s 
because the future were doing it.



So that raises the next an excellent 
question, and an interesting problem.



And that's the concern of stakeholders 
wanting to be involved in the launch of new 
products and the new products being 
disruptive to the existing industry.



How does one balance those two 
somewhat competing aspects.



Let's go back to onion future.



Onion future.



You'll find the reason that the dealer 
community didn't want the transparency and 
to see what was going on in the market.



So one of the advantages of futures 
markets is that they are transparent and 
easily available for all to see what's going on.



What that does is levels the playing field.



Levelling playing field is bad for the 
people that don't have it tilted to their 
advantage.



And good for the people that didn't have it 
tilted to their advantage.

  It is a balance because in an 
exchange essentially what you're talking 
about is a commercial product.



It's proprietary and there's going to be 
delicate and the calculations, and analysis.



Part of that is interacting with members, 
and with users and figuring out the demand 
and figuring out how to best craft the product 
that will have the best appeal.



But those are commercial matters which 
is different from the risk analysis.



That and clearinghouse working with a 
member is really going to the risk 
assessment.



I think there's two separate buckets that 
have to be kept in mind.



Some of whether to establish whether 
there will be activity and two is to determine 
the risk parameters.
I think it's hard to dictate.



It's part of the discussion has to discuss 
with staff and see where there's comfort level 
or not.


It's hard to put metrics on it.

 



&gt;&gt; I think the client clearing service is fee 
based service.



And the way I think most firms would look 
at new products they prioritize.



And so it's it's probably fair to say as new 
products are introduced there's probably 
reciprocal demand for trading formats who 
take the other sides of the trades.

 


 Professor Kyle you discussed silver 
having parallels to the Bitcoin.



Silver had been trading for many years 
and was an accepted futures contract 
without people thinking of it as being 
particularly problematic.



How does that example correspond to 
Bitcoin where it's a newly introduced 
contract.



How is the potential for manipulation 
based on parallel analysis how does that 
affect the process one would use to 
introduce a new contract?

 
So I think that -- well there's some 
parallels.



There are some things that make Bitcoin 
novel compared to silver.



Silver was not only physically delivered 
but because it was essentially part of their 
business.



And Bitcoin is quite different in that the 
ultimate cash market for Bitcoin is quite 
separated from the exchanges, and because 
of that separation I think that's why you have 
the cash settlement rather than the physical 
delivery.



That is the exchanges would like for there 
to be a seamless relationship between the 
cash market and futures market and that 
cash settlement mechanism creates things 
that are novel to silver.



But not novel to other futures contracts 
which are cash settled.



But I think that many of the issues that 
are related to cash settlement have not been 
sorted out from a regulatory perspective 
even within the CFTC or even within the 
legal way in which they're regulated because 
the ability to corner or squeeze or otherwise 
manipulate a contract is not solved by cash 
settlement anyway.



Some people believe cash settlements 
makes them smaller or make them go away.

manderkitteh,"I absolutely despise this website. Two years ago, I used bitcoins to buy some ‚Äúmovie prop‚Ä?IDs (hahah that‚Äôs how they‚Äôre advertised) and the transaction went smoothly, but I used uphold to keep my btc. I left the remainder (a little more than 0.1 btc) in my account since I didn‚Äôt need to spend the full amount I bought for the IDs. It was a fraction of what I paid so I didn‚Äôt really care at first. Then, bitcoins took off, so I logged into my account to find out how much I really had. At the current market rate, an exchange when I logged in 2 years later would have made me $1200. It doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot in the grand scheme of things, but as a 22 year old kid who needs money for textbooks and the occasional night out it‚Äôs a big deal. So I logged into my account and found out that 8 months ago, my bitcoins were transferred to a USD wallet at the rate of about $1400, which means I was credited around $200 or whatever for the fraction of bitcoin that was left. Which is UNACCEPTABLE since I didn‚Äôt make this transaction, and would never have authorized this. I know the money wasn‚Äôt stolen, since it is still in my account and I am still able to transfer the measly $200 into my bank. So I would not ever recommend using this site.

Seriously your claims are baseless and are nothing but wild speculation.

The Federal Reserve has no incentive to make markets crash, as they are a nonprofit entity. That is actually the exact opposite of what they want to do  were made to help mitigate. The natural course of the market is what creates bubbles, panics, and bankruns, and crashes, look at Bitcoin losing 50% of its value in less than a month, that is what unregulated economies and currency actually look like, extremely volatile and insecure investments, that would destroy a nation if it were a basis for an economy. Precisely why the  Federal Reserve exist in the first place.
 
They  also did not create the national debt, nor do thet control it, that has existed since Hamilton, and it's controlled by the Treasurey.  The part the Fed does play in national debt is nothing like you seem to be describing, as they buy Treasurey bonds, and hold them for the governement temporarily to take them out of circulation, and then give them back to the government when QE is over. Beyond that the Fed actually generates income for the Federal government and pay whatever post- cost revenue from interest from lending to banks they make per annum back into the treasurey. So yeah  seriously the Fed is in no way some evil conspiracy, it's just a boring regulatory agency designed to keep the economy working and the banks honest at the end of each day. It's a distraction and the anti-fed narrative is actually pushed by bankers who would make a lot more money off of the backs of the poor if there was no Fed holding them accountable or regulating their behavior. Those are just facts about how the world works and actual reality, I guess if you want to exist in a fantasy land that is your choice but seriously don't pretend you are actually educated on the subject becuase you watch conspiracy videos on youtube.",dtjb5e4,2,1/31/2018 14:22,,,,,,

Anenome5,"I agree with disintermediation intentions for original bitcoin.

As for the technicals, understanding it is important to distinguish between coins, tbh. Ethereum has topped out on transactions per second at 15, regularly costs a dollar a transaction, and was never meant to be a currency in the first place, but rather a smart contracting system.

Cardano is new and speculative, imo. Haven't looked too much into that but I'm not sure I like their Proof of Stake consensus mechanism being mass voting or w/e. Proof of work seems far better to me, currently.

Ethereum is talking about switching over to proof of stake to fix their scaling woes. Their scaling woes are tied to their 15 second block-time. Short block times are a major error of the early bitcoin era, IMO, and both litecoin and other jumped into that without considering the ramifications. Now, Ethereum can't scale further due to its short block-time, has major orphan problems--but again, it's not meant to be a currency so that doesn't matter.

IMO, bitcoincash is the original bitcoin from a technical point of view, keeping the direction established by Satoshi and the early bitcoin developers who brought the coin from zero to its first $1,000, and I expect it in time to take over as the main coin, once people move past their bias of BTC as the so-called original coin, realize that it's been hijacked and its mission and emphasis changed so much that it's not usable anymore like it was.",dtjb4iv,2,1/31/2018 14:22,,,,,,

Bitcoin isn't really anything more than a series of ledgers that record transactions, i.e. a list of ""Person A sends Person B X amount of bitcoin"", with the entire thing being called the blockchain.

Before a block of transactions is added to the blockchain, someone needs to solve a cryptographic math puzzle that involves the data in the block. Miners put their computers to work to do a bunch of math, and whoever finds the solution first is rewarded with some bitcoin, and it all starts over with the next block of transactions. 

The article describes how miners are using ads to put other people's computers to work in solving these math puzzles, and if one of the victims' computers happens to stumble across the solution, the solution is sent back to the miner for them to collect the rewards.",dtjb006,2,1/31/2018 14:20,,,,,,

This interesting event that I followed since the early stage, helped me to understand different things:
- cryptocurrencies is a world that is already in mass adoption mode because apparently the majority of  the holders of cryptocurrencies  they want just to became rich in 1/10000 of the time that Bitcoin reached that price.
- the technical knowledge behind the blockchains and how a cryptocurrency actually works is very limited from what I can see (and I put myself in this basket too ) and it's interesting to see loads of people who they don't even question themselves how actually a cryptocurrency is working. This is probably because they are still thinking in terms of paper money.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:  If I make a purchase with my crypto, what does that mean for taxes?

**A: Since crypto is property, if you use it to make a purchase, that is the sale of that property and it has to be reconciled and reported as a capital gain/loss. Basically what you sold it for minus what you bought it for minus any costs of the transactions. They all need to be documented and tallied up in the year end tax return. Coin to fiat sales, coin to coin sales, coin to purchase goods or services sales. We have tools and a team that help make this process more manageable.**

Q: If you're trading account showed a profit of 15k on December 31 but on January 25 it was only 5k, you have never withdrew a penny, the irs expects you to pay tax on 10k that you don't have? This has to be somewhat common due to the fact of the current bear market now. Would the answer be you should of taken the money out at the end of the year taxed it and re-deposit it back to you account and ""start from scratch""?

**A: Correct. The thought process is that you are supposed to pay it as you are making the money. Taking it out at the end of year would have created more sales and potentially profits to add into the mix so it wouldn't give you any ability to ""start from scratch"". Every transaction is always reportable. We advise our clients to pay their taxes quarterly and keep track of profits throughout the year so that they don't get hit with surprise tax bills that they are not prepared for.**

Q: Will holding onto coins or tokens for longer than 365 days allow gains from their sale to be taxed as capital gains instead of ordinary income?

**A: Yes, short term gains (crypto HODL'd for less than 1 year) are taxed at your ordinary income tax rates which are between 0% and 39.6% (depending on your overall income with most people being in the 0-25% range). Long term gains (crypto HODL'd for more than 1 year) are taxed at the lower, capital gains rate of 0-20% (with most people towards the lower end of that spectrum).**

Q: Can you comment on how the new tax law in the US will impact cryptocurrency trading in 2018 compared to prior years? 

**A: It will lower tax rates, other than that, no change to crypto.**

Q:Apparently there is a rule that US taxpayers are supposed to report foreign accounts over $10,000. Can you comment on whether this applies to cryptocurrency accounts? If so, how do we know what counts as a foreign or domestic exchange or account?

**A: Correct. FBAR requirements state that anyone having any funds over 10,000 in any overseas institution (exchanges) has to file a Fincen 114 form. The penalties for not doing so range from $10,000 PER instance (each exchange, each year) to the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the balance in an unreported foreign account. If someone wasn't compliant in previous years and comes forward, there are ways to mitigate those fines. Checking if they are foreign or not is usually available on the exchanges site on where they are located. Decentralized exchanges are in a grey area, chances are that they are not part of this requirement if you are in the US when working with them however it may be better to just file the form. We file it for all of our clients to make sure they stay in compliance if they have anything in an overseas exchange.**

Q: If i lost money, would i be able to claim capitol loss?

**A: Correct, only if there there is a total net loss - subject to only being able to claim up to $3k per year in losses with the rest carrying forward to future years to offset income or future gains). In either case, all the trades need to be reported in order to determine any total net loss or gain from the trades.**

Q: I always wondered how taxes worked if you mined bitcoin years ago and made a killing... would you be taxed on the full thing? What if you were paid in BTC for a service long ago?

**A: Hey, if someone was mining years ago, they should have been reporting that mining income in the years they earned it. The way it works on mining income is that it is self employment income if you are doing it personally (not in a Corp or LLC). It flows to your schedule C where you put the total mining income you had for the year, then you can deduct any direct expenses you had for the mining. Those would be the portion of your electricity that you used for those rig(s), the ability to depreciate your equipment purchase costs and even possibly a portion of your rent or mortgage that is exclusively used for housing the mining equipment (whether it is a space in your living room or basement or a full warehouse). Then the net amount of profit is taxed at your ordinary tax rate (which is determined by your total income from all sources). Additionally, self employment income is subject to Self Employment taxes which are 15.3% althoguh you do then get to deduct 1/2 of your self employment taxes as an above the line deduction (adjustment to income). If someone wasn't claming their mining income, it is recccomended to do so and catch up as the IRS is working with Chainanalysis to get forensic data from the chain and could tie everything together with their other data sources. US law requires that all citizens and residents income; whether from a job, investment, in cash, or in crypto be reported and taxed from your worldwide income be reported and taxed. Otherwise it would be illegal tax evasion and subject to penalties, interest and possibly fines. If someone was making a killing and not claiming it, it could also be subject to criminal penalties.**

**If you were paid in BTC for a service a long time ago, that should have been included in Schedule C as well. If it weren't, the penalties and interest can be much lower for self reporting and amending it rather than waiting to possibly get caught.**

antiname,"According to

http://www.altcointoday.com/bitcoin-ethereum-vs-visa-paypal-transactions-per-second/

Visa does about 150 million transactions a day.

According to 

https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption

(Search ""Comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption to other payment systems"")

100 000 visa transactions take about 169 kWh, so visa consumes about 25350 kWh a day, or about 9 million kWh a year, according to 

https://yearbook.enerdata.net/total-energy/world-consumption-statistics.html

This constitutes about 0.000005 percent of the worlds energy consumption.

Looking at that same site, the power consumption of one bitcoin transaction is 500 kWh. If somehow 150 million bitcoin transactions could be made in a day, that would be about
75 billion kWh a day, or about 27 Trillion kWh per year. According to the same energy consumption chart I showed earlier, that constitutes about *15%* of the total energy consumption of the world. It's only going to get worse.

Everybody parroting: ""The bitcoin bubble is about to pop"" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is exponential.
So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020, since it came from less than $1 to $10,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential 'S-Curve' of adoption.

LovelyDay,"It a reversal of the frequent Core supporter viewpoint / argument that ""we should keep the block size small"" so that even Raspberry Pi users and home users with low disk space can run a ""full node"". This strategy (keep the 1MB limit, scale by Segwit and block Segwit2x) has resulted in the recent period of extremely high fees on Bitcoin (BTC), as was always predicted (see my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7uaef0/just_because_you_have_a_small_computer_does_not/dtj5gfn/)).

To their credit, most Core developers have said they support some kind of increase. But we haven't heard anything further in terms of increases beyond what Segwit as-is could deliver. No roadmap for a future increase on Core's side.

So the next time the 1mb (+ a little segregated txs) fills up, BTC will enjoy its next bout of high fees. All because of a strict policy against increasing the block size cap, supposedly to protect those with the lowest-common-denominator systems.

I know the argument made for it has been to keep the network as decentralized as possible. I'll be happy to explain how that approach fails to keep the network decentralized if the limit is kept so low that demand far exceeds block space.",dtjakke,2,1/31/2018 14:13,,,,,,
HTownian25,"&gt; Any additional price above the cost of production falls under the category of rent.

It's a little broader than that, as ""production"" entails transportation, preservation, assembly, maintenance, etc, etc.  And this does muddy the waters, as you need to start asking whether a guy operating a refrigerated warehouse constitutes a renter or a worker.

But yeah, bitcoin is - functionally speaking - a tool of accounting.  It's no different than a ledger pad or an abacus in that regard.  So it has ""value"" in so far as it has utility.  The better question might be ""does it have net implicit utility relative to other accounting tools?""

Coiners seem to think so.  The rest of us remain deeply skeptical.",dtjajz4,2,1/31/2018 14:13,,,,,,

###FAQ

**Are you wearing the panties in the picture right now?**  
*No, most likely I'm not. I try to make a new panty add every day, but that doesn't mean I wear a new pair of panties every day. I advertise a different pair every day to show you a few of the available options. In reality, none of my panties are pre-worn. Everything is custom-ordered (with the addons of your choosing) and I will start wearing your panties of choice after you ordered them. That way you can get them just the way you like them!* 

**When will you start wearing my panties?**  
*There's no constant in this. Usually I can start wearing them in a few days. Sometimes it's a few weeks, sometimes it's instantly. Feel free to ask me though! I'll always be able to tell you when I can start wearing them before you decide to buy.* 

**What are zones? How does it work?**  
*Zone 1 is the part of the panty gusset that is around the frontmost part of the vulva, mostly the clit.*  
*Zone 2 is the part of the gusset that is where the vagina is*  
*Zone 3 is the part of the gusset that covers my little asshole. Working out in the panties can cause this zone to be very strong.* 

**What is ""extra anal attention""?**  
*If you order ""extra anal attention"", I will make sure zone 3 gets more attention. I don't like talking about it much, so let's not get into the specifics of how I do that.* 

**What's ""No Shower""?**  
*This means I don't shower while I'm wearing your panties. I won't allow this addon beyond 48 hours, so if you want a 3-day wear with no shower, it will mean i will shower either after 24h or after 48h (you can choose).* 

**How do you package the panties?**  
*Unless asked otherwise, I will fold the gusset together and use a vacuum sealer to suck all the air out. If you would prefer me to wrap wax paper around the gusset, please ask me.* 

**What is gusset stuffing and what's the difference with panty stuffing?**  
*The gusset is the part of the panty that rests against the vulva and asshole. If you order gusset stuffing, I stuff that part of the panty into my vagina. I don't do full panty stuffing, because it just doesn't fit.* 

**Do you talk and show face?**  
*I don't talk nor show full face (I have a venetian eye mask) in videos, but other than that I'm pretty open minded!* 

**I have other questions!**  
*Please check my [General FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Purpleflower88/wiki/faq) for answers to questions that apply to everything that I do*

**Author**:  _BootyPoppinPanda_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

&gt;Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay each other without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hubs will only be based in developing nations. KYC requirements will close down any successful hubs in developed nations &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;I'm not of the opinion that lighting is WORTHLESS... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

&gt;But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.",dtja8kz,2,1/31/2018 14:08,,,,,,

I am a firm domme - well experienced in virtually all D/s dynamics. I love playing with sissies and cucks but I thoroughly enjoy vanilla (non-fetish related) play as well. I love odd requests and encourage you to bring me fun/challenging requests (with an accompanying budget). I am 420 friendly and I **do** show face!

###My Snapchat handle is [xlaineylovex](https://snapchat.com/add/xlaineylovex)
###My kik handle is LaineyLactate

---------------------------

* **PM me on Reddit when you are looking for a Snapchat subscription or session**
* **Do NOT contact me on kik/snap unless you are ready to send payment**
* **If you contact me to arrange a session on kik please include: a description of the session you're looking for(text only, vid heavy etc as well as any fetish requests), a budget that matches the pricing listed below, your intended payment method (options below), and when you want to do the session. Messages outside of this format will be redirected to Reddit. PM me by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=laineyloves2lactate)** 
* **If you have any questions pertaining to Snapchat or sending payment read the entirety of my ad as well as my ToS on my subreddit (r/laineylove) and PM me on Reddit with your question or intended payment method.**

-------------------------

##Lainey's Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. Please note that I also offer kik sessions at the same rates as snap! As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions where you will have my full attention for the duration of your session. Unless otherwise negotiated I will start clothed and strip throughout the session, showing myself off, and interacting with whatever content you decide to send me. Once the session has started I will not pause or delay the session for any reason. While I'm open to suggestions and requests during your session, I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate our agreement without refund and may result in being banned on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on kik or Snapchat but it is my preference to use kik and it allows you to have the conversation for later use üòâ

-------------------------

##Cock and Cumshot Ratings

###Options for ratings include:

Rate|Price
:--|:-:
Text|$15
Video|$25
Nude Video|$35

My ratings are provided in clips through kik recorded just for you. All video ratings vary in length depending on how much I have to say but will include a 1-10 rating as well as a detailed review about its appearance, what I would do with it, and my overall satisfaction. If you want me to use your name please allow for an additional $10 and I'll make sure to use it throughout the entire rating as if you were sitting right there before me, ready to play. Ratings are not intended to be interactive so please refrain from making any requests. I do not provide any pics/vids to help you get ready for your rate but I encourage you to check out r/LaineyLove to get yourself rock hard üòâ


Rate Addon [AVAILABLE FOR NUDE RATINGS ONLY]|Additional Cost
:--|:-:
Name use|$10
The Worship Rating|$10
Extra JOI and showing off|$20
Extra showing off with pussy play|$30
Cumshot rate in addition to dick rate|$25
Rate provided in one continuous video instead of over kik clips|$25

------------------------------

##Premium Snapchat Subscription

Snapchat subscriptions give access to my private story which will contain nudes (picture and video) as well as a variety of other real life and SFW updates. This may include: nudes, teasing, public exposure, day to day check-ins, boy/girl content, early access to sales, updates on pre-made videos! I have been having a wild time and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day. For premium subscribers and only at my discretion I will open any content sent to me although I reserve the right to respond. I prefer to receive pictures of you smoking, chilling with your pets, doing something exciting, and **NOT** NSFW content. This does NOT include any guaranteed interaction and buyers should not purchase a snapchat subscription with the expectation of having daily chat.

Subscription|Price
:--|:-:
1 Month|$30
3 Months|$60
12 Months|$90

As a supply-inelastic asset class value fluctuates according to demand, which goes up and down regardless of what crypto is paired with what. Because the only pair that matters is with fiat currencies. The clue is that everyone refers to the price in **dollar** values. **This** is the pairing to be concerned with if you want to create a coin that does not trade in lock step with all the others.

 I would like to start by thanking commissioner Benham, commissioner -- it's an important topic in today's advisory commission.

My name is ed, and I am the global commissioner and today I speak on behalf of -- today explores the manner in which new and novel products are certified by exchanges.

In December, giving this committee a prime example, to co Ar certifying they have fulfilled their 

responsibility as set out in the core principle 

of the act and.



These core principles require exchanges 
to attest that safe requirements are in place 
to insure these contracts are furthering 
response trading.



And it comes with the reciprocal 
responsibilities.



Today represented the clear member 
community the that play the pivotal role in 
the clearing of these products and.



By margining, and clearing houses and 
committing to assessment obligations during 
clearinghouse shortfall.



One of the primary benefits of clearing is 
through the clearing member default fund.



This protects the and the contagion that 
requires clearing skimmings their clearing 
members to the strict requirements.



This is due to the fact that the clearing 
members are all exposed to all members.



Clearing members cannot firewall 
themselves away from others in the clearing 
system.



And there were various opinions within 
the industry about the riskiness of the 
products and how to properly manage the 
pore.



These were by no means product 
announcements.



And the FCM believes that the launch of 
these exchange derivatives would have 
benefitted from more two-way dialogue from 
the clearing firms that would be clearing the 
risks in the case of a default.



In this instance it was minimal scamper 
formal conversation depriving on certainkey 
questions whether a separate guarantee 
fund was print or whether the exchange 
should put it in another fund.



And whether the products were 
procedural margined.



And two weeks aGodoy to gather and 
accommodate concerned parties including 
trading firms and FCMs.



And alower to healthy and rigorous 
dialogue.



Similar for the exchange of rules.



The comments received by the industry 
and how they were addressed.



This would add to the self-certification 
process and process the CFTC with 
assurances of core principle are being met.



We also believe that the cryptocurrencies 
are not the only class that should benefit 
from the rule changes.



And it's quite possible to add these 
enhancements in place and the industry 
been properly consulted we would have 
ended up in the same place.



It's our understanding that the CFTC also 
plans to look how exchange governance 
oversees these products.



And it's equally important that the 
exchange governance be instructed to make 
sure that risk strategies are being 
addressed.



In conclusion we do not believe that 
however we commend the Chairman and the 
Commission for their willingness to comment 
on the recent Bitcoin launch.



I appreciate your willingness to discuss 
this on the agenda.

 Thank you.

I will leave that all over to you and let you make an entr'acte

 introductory statement and we will move to questions.

Thank you.

I'm peat Kyle.

What I would like to do is take a step back in time to ninety 79 and 1980 when you had the hunt brother the operating in the silver market and the reason to think about it is Bitcoin has the value and is speculative and it can be move around in certain ways.  So far when silver future started trading I don't think anybody thought of them as posing a risk to the economy but when the Hunts cornered the market, it became irrelevant and you had 14 days in a row where there were limit the moves and I think there was a collapse in the market in one day.

Even though people thought it might not happen, the fed got involved and by turning off credit to finance commodity speculation, made it the Hunt silver corner unravel.

And in the end the process discouraged customers from trading silver and many prevented customers from trading silver futures.

And the hunt brothers themselves, used a technique where they hid the ownership of the people they were cooperating with and in those days it was through Swiss secrecy law and it took the CFC a few years to unravel what happened.

And later were able to figure it out.

There was a very close connection between the cash market and the future the market, so if you focused on the manipulation of the contract, you would be in trouble in the 1980s because the hunt brothers cornered the market and are very important.

So there are a lot of things to remember about that episode so the question here is what's novel about -- I'm going to phrase it as what's novel about Bitcoin.

There are several differences that make the Bitcoin situation different from the situation of silver in the 1980s.

The first is that Bitcoin is a cash settlement and you have to pay close attention to how the cash settlement works.

What we heard earlier was that the CFTC does not like to see big aggressive trades taking place right at the end of the trading during the settlement period, this could be big aggressive trades in the futures market but also in the cash market.

But I would like to point out, if you were the hunt brothers and dealing in bit counties, in the market through a company through that capitalizes as much as possible so you do nothing and when the contract cash settled but by waiting for the contracts to expire you would put huge upward prices, and the prices by position end even though you actually do nothing.

So with a person with a large position in the cash market, that you don't observe pulse there bit coins off the exchanges, or has a separate identity with which bit coins are owned, they can pull off a corner and not appear to do much of anything as a pull it off.

Bitcoin is different in the that it is even hard tore figure out who ultimately owns the bit coins than to peers the Swiss sequency laws.

And finally Bitcoin is novel in that the fundamentals of supply and demand aren't there.

It's speculative type of commodity, it can be linked by others, and so there -- it's very difficult to scientifically apply principles.

There is some kind of fundamentals to supply and demand that make them worth or not worth something.

So let me stop there.  ",dtj9vi4,2,1/31/2018 14:02,,,,,,

coltstrgj,"Let me get this right out of the way, I don't really like, or trust lightning network. I don't think off chain solutions are real solutions to nearly any problem. There are very limited times when I think it could be useful and this is not one of them IMO. I also expect that the people ""in charge"" of btc are going to be a lot brighter than I am and not purposely kill the coin because it would benefit them to keep it around so they can keep making money off of it, so I don't expect bitcoin to have any malicious breaking changes. However, for the purpose of this argument I will assume that lightning does everything it says it will and is secure, etc. 

I also think that it's fair to post pretending that bitcoin is the only coin I could use, and no other cryptocurrency exists. This will lead us to discuss more about the actual topic rather than who does what best, because I think the underlying question (the one that OP posted) is more important to answer right now. 

Now that that is done, I think that the argument op provides is wrong for a couple reasons. 

---

 From my understanding you only have to run a full node if you want to validate others transactions. This means that it will be easy for users to make transactions without strong hardware. This effectively means that they contribute nothing to the network's strength/security/decentralization while still using the network. They basically provide nothing but cost something. 

BUT, I don't think that it really matters. I think that Metcalfe's law plays a large role here. I can't imagine a food truck paying for an ASIC rig and all the power required to run it, and I want to be able to use bitcoin at a food truck, so it's worth it to me to try to provide something for them. I don't mine, so my ""something provided"" is fees. 

I don't mind if my fees increase a little bit due to demand (obviously I'm talking about small fees, nothing like what BTC has right now, but a few cents wouldn't bother me). I want more people to be able to participate, and if lightning will bring fees under control, allow anybody to use bitcoin quickly and easily that will be good for me and everybody else. There's no point to me having bitcoin if I can only spend it a couple places, and I can only spend it a couple places if it doesn't get easier/cheaper to use. 

And this extra overhead of users shouldn't matter to the proposed fees. We're talking about a few satoshi here. If we double that, quadruple that, whatever, I really don't give a fuck. Sure it costs ""more"" but it's worth it for the added utility.

uy88,"&gt; I answer questions like this all the time for my job

May I ask what you do for a job?

&gt;try to ban monero or would they just make it so onerous to use that it isn't any better than using Bitcoin?

It won't work. People are not dumb, or let's say the people with money are not dumb (most of them). The money will flow to the fairer, more efficient system. A censored coin is just not what people want, especially people with money. The tactics you refer to worked for fiat because there was no competition. The few coins that tried to compete in America were shut down quickly and violently. Now with unstoppable competition, the best coin is what people will use. No amount of pushing can change that, people will always work around that.

&gt;How could businesses accept it if it were illegal?

Like I said above, off the books. In fact making xmr illegal would motivate more and more business to be done off the books which would backfire on them.

&gt;they would require you to give your view keys and key images to the IRS

Do you seriously think that is enforceable? Even if people were required to register their xmr wallet, they would just create other private wallets for ""real"" use. Any attempt at enforcing such rules would be laughable and destroy any credibility the enforcers may have had.

1500,pdrayton,&gt;&gt; I'll take this", to start off with, because it seems right up my alley.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
 we decided go with a single clearing fund for a variety of reasons.,,,,,,,,,,
 the margining around it, the volatility was consistent with products we have now.,,,,,,,,,
 and to the members themselves.,,,,,,,,,,
 because there is a diverse risk.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
 and the Claring members.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
 very similar to what was done at OCC, there was a lot of analysis done around the risk profile of these contract and while the volatility can look significant, when we put it in light of other things that we have cleared and cleared, in terms of electricity contracts or even emerging market currencies, those are actually more volatile than what we have seen with the Bitcoin futures contract so we feel confident that the risk management that we have around that, the margin that we're collecting, 43 percent of notional are in range with similar type commodities in the range of 1.5 to 4.6 percent, the Bitcoin futures were over 40 percent and the initial base margin, we're collecting about 59 million for Bitcoin futures today that's off of 90 billion in the overall fund for base margin so that's .7 percent, we think that is definitely covering the risk this was certainly discussed but from all the characteristics the fact that we have five years of back tested data to analyze, we felt confident that we were going to be able and again this is a future's contract based on an index and cash settled product that we handled hundreds of other products very similar.
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
 frankly no one would ever suggest you do that because we think of the equities class as an asset class vertical so you wouldn't want to split up the correlated component parts but we have also grown up in businesses for those of us who have spent time in thick for example, actions that were made by the CME to put interest rates Swaps separate from the options and interest rate pool, the interests rates and FX and ICE was the same with CDFS and maybe we can say that made that decision because at the point which they start clearing, they were able to say that should something go wrong with this product we would be able to isolate away from the vanilla --,,,,,,,
 but what is the criteria in your mind to make a decision to break it out versus not.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
 there were no interest rate Swaps going on and the same with -- when the clearing started, there were different considerations on the period risks looking at five days of period risk, interest rate Swaps and default Swaps on a one day interest it seemed to try to cram that into one day pool -- ,,,,,,,,
 the OTC and credit default Swaps are required for participation for jeep of the members and that does not happen on the futures side or the options side on the exchange derivative so it's those types of considerings, what is the thing you're doing for default management.,,,,,,,,,
 you need to look at default management, that would get you in the world of I need a different clearing fund when you look at default management that we would employ for an exchange derivative, that's where it leaned toward keeping it more in the same fund.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
 it's different where we talking about cash instruct, we had reported levels of one clearing contract, our account for every person that's holding a position.  We're in a position where clearing firms have credit controls and disable down to the account level so their ability as well as clearing house ability to liquid eight positions that would be a concern as well as that two day margin coverage makes it again, appear so much more similar to all of the other futures contract that we clear today and does not have those same characters.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
 we would be able to to default management on it, price it, can I risk manage it in the same way I do with the rest of the exchange trade derivative so I don't think I could answer that question without more data and pricing and how things are settled how whether it's cash or delivered, is it traded on an exchange traded platform or am I getting it over-the-counter.,,,,,,,

&gt;&gt; I'm Dale from the options, especially in light of the conference  governance process we went through at OCC Bitcoin.
We take with respect to the perspective of risk management area, I want to give you a little bit of insight into the overall process we go through for the product.
First we cover all equity options in the U.S. both broad based and single use.
We cover CBOA futures NASDAQ futures we know a little bit about volatility with single risk and options on those.
With any new product, what we look for is the risk management aspects around the product.
What we put in there to make sure that we have the proper controls in place.
With the new product we're looking at is there anything new or novel about a product we are bringing is it an existing extension of a product or is this something of a new asset class if it is something that is deemed new or novel it goes through an internal and external process on risk management surrounding those products.
So let me give you insight into the Bitcoin.
With our margin model at OCC we use the stance margin model, there is a minimum of one period day of risk for margins and at OCC we play to date period of risk for margins even more conservative standard than the minimum we also have a short model, rather than looking at a 99 percent bar model, cut off at 99 percent, we look at tail risks so we look at 99 percent all the way to 100 percent and average those coming up with our 99 percent coverage levels.
It's a more conservative type of risk management that we employ at OCC and when looking at Bitcoin.
In the data, two years, back testing to ensure that our margin model can support the product.
When we looked at the back testing can we cover 99 percent in our short fall method and risk.
We found out that it did so very routinely we then went back and said two years might not be indicative of all the market that we have seen.
So we went back even further than what we have been seeing most recently we went back to 2013 and stretched our model back then and checked to see if we could cover that volatility.
We were able to cover that at 99 percent as well.  We went further and on the historical stress periods we also looked at and shared this information with our risk meets.
This is something that we do on a -- with any type of novel or new product as well and I'll get to that in a bit.
But this is, part of the initial margin, how we got comfortable with the fact that we had the first line of defense with the initial margin and we're doing daily variation with the market moves so we're doing a daily variation but covering a two day market risk so we're taking the risk off the table each day.
We also looked at the stress testing of the products what is that we do to cover clearing fund.
Our margin came out about 40 percent or so a we do calculate this on a daily basis.
Every day a new comes in.
We looked at the stress testing and figured out how that might employ into our current fund and would that coexist with the products that we have and what stress parameters we have to have for the Bitcoin products.
We stressed over 100 percent going to the upside nearly down to zero on the downside and we looked at how this fits into the product set that we cleared.
Should this be in the single fund product and this is a discussion that we have with the risk committee.
Also looking at the pricing products where do we get the backing and what are the limits what are the pricing structures in place.
Are there other sources of price thats  that we can get.
That's what we continue to track to ensure the pricing is consistent.
One thing to note is since the Bitcoin markets have launched at C BoE and looking at other venues the correlations have increased.
We're seeing better price information on the markets.
We also look at default management capability that we hit and employ with each products who is going to be clearing these products who are the market makers if we do have a problem, if a member does default when they have these in their portfolio.
And an idea of where to go with these types of products if there is a default.
Overseeing all this assist risk risk meet of our board.
Along with independents and a subset of our board of directors, they started looking at this back in July of this past year, looking at the same type of things that I brought out here earlier, looking at the margin model, back testing, stress testing, looking at the clearing fund, they had particular interest in the pricing.
This was not just one conversation but multiple conversations with our risk committee to get everyone involved and understanding of the risk management and improve the risk management that we had around this product.
Since the time that we have launched the product we have gone through an expiration, a seamless expiration in January of the product and weigh mentioned seeing volume and open interest both increasing at the CME and -- we have seen higher correlations in the pricing so all in all a very good first couple of months, and I should also mention as I mentioned earlier in the panel, we talked with the risk committee this information was shared with the CFC, they were asking at CFC and FCC since they are our primary regulator at the OCC, all our products and bad testing going to more stress periods was all shared with the CFC, numerous types of discussions with CFCC staff and monTative focused staff so they can understand what we're doing on the back testing margin model on all those.
Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Hi.
I'm Trabue, and I am vice president of the -- we don't actually have a Bitcoin project but we do follow all the processes and procedure that my colleagues at the panel just discussed so I'm not going to add to what they said.
I look forward to your questions and thank you for inviting us.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
I think perhaps the place to start the conversation in this segment of the MRAC meeting is around processes for stakeholder input, to the extent that the commissions process does not involve public comment and does not really have an opportunity for public participation, to what extent do these exchanges is the clearing houses have a process or provide for not only input from their risk committees, but also their larger stakeholder audiences?
&gt;&gt; I'll start.
This process, I would say was quite lengthy for us.
Entente  we spent about a year on the launch.
Over a year ago we started looking at the asset class that we call crypto.
We spent a number of months with many of the participants in that market.
Most of our market makers on our future's exchange were already dealers in the crypto market, so it was our client that came to us asking for a derivative contract that they could use.
So it was a solution created by clients at the outset of the discussions.
We obviously had a lot of internal analysis of the product, and the underlying asset class, and we moved into what we call the client interface phase, we decided that due to the nape of nature of this product we needed to announce our interest because it could impact our stock prices, so we announced a future in Bitcoin, and that's when we were more able to formerly engage our clients in the products.",dtj9nkn,2,1/31/2018 13:59,,,,,,

itslevi,"PRL's lost almost 90% of its fiat value in less than a month. It's not technically incorrect to say it's ""market related"", but no coin in the top 10 shed that much market cap. Not even close. It's not a coincidence that KCS, PRL, DRG, BNTY, and DBC pumped and crashed together. It was on a pump and dump on the entire Kucoin exchange. 

Now here is where people will clamor, ""but PRL isn't a PnD! It's SO MUCH MORE!"" Good coins can be PnD'ed and manipulated. Actually, it's arguably easier, the fact that it was manipulated does not discredit the legitimacy of the coin or its prospects for the future. The evidence that the price of Bitcoin was heavily manipulated on Mt. Gox is damning. 

However, the significance of the fact that PRL was PnD'ed is that its ATH is a meaningless indicator of real prospects for the coin's value. Instead, the questions you should be asking are the exact same questions that you should be asking of any promising up-and-coming altcoin.

These are relatively simple questions that anyone should be asking of any investment they make, like ""if websites start monetizing through PRL, would that actually cause the price of PRL to go up?"" Instead, these questions are suppressed in favor of blind buying/HODLing because that's the state of altcoin mania. Or at least it was- as you alluded, the market is becoming less FOMO-prone and more jaded with the nonstop alt shilling, so coins that can't answer these simple questions are suffering and will continue to suffer.

fizzlespan,"Wow. Wasn't expecting this. Here are my thoughts: I do agree with your point that the current state of DAPPs development is somehow cumbersome. Ethereum and EOS are working on improving it, but that doesn't mean they'll ever be better than the Bitcoin eco-system. 

You've to realize that Bitcoin primary focus is money, while Ethereum and EOS are decentralized general purpose web applications. It's unfair to make those statements against the technology that started it all, and by the way, it started like that because of some reason. 

I've been using the Bitcoin Lightning Network and it's not only a work of art but also very easy to use. 

Remember that there'll always be something apparently better around the corner. Yesterday, it was Ethereum, today its EOS, but tomorrow might be XOS. Does that mean we should dump EOS, and start using XOS?

Bitcoin has been built in a way that can serve as the foundation for something greater, money-wise. You don't need much to build an app: that generates a wallet, opens a channel, and credits you some money to use with anything that accepts Bitcoin as a form of payment.

Many people like to make the comparison between the Internet and the current state of multi-level bitcoin goals. Gmail UX is great because it runs on top of the OSI layer.

My point is: the solution should not be the building of a single layer, but the building of multi-layers which allows you to build different things on top.

Anyway, to conclude: I completely agree with your DAPPs context-wise argument.

devilldog,"A quick look at coinmarketcap.com total market capitilization and specifically the Percentage of Total Market Capitalization (Dominance) diagram will show BTC is consistently less dominant while ETH seems to be steadily climbing to the top.
This cycle of first mover advantage eventually winding down and being replaced due to it's typical disadvantages is no a surprise to anyone that actually participates in markets. We've all seen and experienced this whether it be Nintendo replacing Atari (this will date you), cds replacing cassetts, brick &amp; mortar vs online retail, etc. I'm not saying BTC is going away. I totally can see it being a great store of value. I'm just not sure that is enough to retain it's spot at #1. In fact I'm surprised it has retained #1 for as long as it has. A typical first mover is in many ways the opposite of BTC. First movers tend to keep all their technology private and tend to slowly bleed it out through published research, movement of employees or active reverse engineering through competitors. They will even use any legal recourse available to protect it (patents, etc). BTC and much of the public blockchain is nothing like that. You can readily see the tech, read the whitepapers, download the code via github even fork an existing blockchain you believe you have found a way to improve. Despite few of the typical first mover advantages Bitcoin has remained king. It's no surprise that the disadvantages would seem to weigh so heavily on it within the existing cryptoasset market. Typical disadvantages to being ""First-mover"" are Free-rider effects, Resolution of technological or market uncertainty, Shifts in technology or customer needs and Incumbent inertia. Obvious examples of free riders within the space are BCC, and all BTC forks - even LTC and other POW (proof of work) Blockchain cryptoassets benefited by BTC's initial entry.
Resolution of Tech and market uncertainty are less obvious but noticeable factors as well. The market as we know it now (as volatile as it is) does not compare with the uncertainty BTC and others endured initially. The confidence garnered from the pioneers in this space is what allows new cryptoassets with less obvious utility to enter the existing market.
The shifts in technology and customer needs within this market are moving at an unbelievable pace. Solid CryptoAssets with incredible resources and programmers have failed to keep up with volume. Transaction speed and costs have already begun to impact the market heavily. There is simply too much competition to ignore this. To be clear there are still glaring hurdles for many cryptoassets such as BTC, ETH and even Monero that have not yet been overcome. Some of the technical hurdles such as speed and costs of transactions may even be fixable while other issues such as the very viability of POW itself may be less easy to resolve. Most of the issues, once recognized, need time and resources to resolve them. The problem with Incumbent inertia and why it is such a key weakness for BTC is the inability to recognize and act on these issues. Underlying Tech that might cause miners to replace hardware or changes in block size to deal with transaction times are either ignored or unable to reach consensus due to the status quo being ""good enough"". A Crypto that is unable to quickly adept in this space will lose its assets(or dominance in market cap). That appears to be the case for BTC.

TLDR: BTC got complacent and altcoins(specifically ETH) are kicking its assets.

hobbers,"Unfortunately, the idea of error-proof accounting is not unique to Bitcoin specifically. Rather, Bitcoin is just one particular implementation of this accounting method. So placing value in Bitcoin is not placing value in the idea overall, just this particular implementation.  
  
In my opinion, the idea of error-proof accounting (and not just the desire, we've desired it for a long time) overall is revolutionary. If I had a way to invest in the idea overall, I would be placing a lot of my assets in it. Error-proof accounting has the ability to disrupt some truly massive markets in the world. Bringing transaction times and costs down to almost nothing.

ebaley,"&gt;The demand for Bitcoin was from speculators who thought they could get rich quick from it. 

And what would initiate such a thing? It had been in a bear market for two years. It had been hanging around $200 for ages after hitting $1200. It did not look like a get rich scheme mid-2015 to mid-2016.

Only a sudden decrease in supply would initiate a new bull market.

And anyway - there's nothing wrong if people think it will make them rich. It fosters adoption. No one is buying Bitcoin or any crypto to buy stuff on the web.

&gt;Bitcoin has the slowest transaction fees and times, is not anonymous, and can only be used as a coin, unlike other platforms.

New tech like lightning, MimbleWimble make these arguments redundant. And Bitcoin is still the most decentralized and secure Blockchain - which is most important.

siddhartha-komodo,"There are currently 3 ways to split your UTXOs: automatic, semi-automatic, and no automation.

The lead developer of our Agama wallet, pbca26, recently created a new feature that provides the semi-automatic option. It allows users to send funds to another address in a manner that splits the total amount into separate UTXOs, with the intent of preparing the funds for atomic swaps. Users will indicate the number and sizes of their desired UTXOs when prompted by the wallet. This feature should be publicly available in one of the upcoming Agama releases.

Developers of BarterDEX GUI apps can adopt the semi-automatic UTXO-management feature into their standalone GUI applications. 

There are currently two leading BarterDEX GUI apps. One is the creative product of Satinder Grewal, a long-time developer in the Komodo network, and this one has the majority of advanced BarterDEX features already implemented. The other is the creative product of ca333, CTO of the Komodo team. This second one is currently simplified, with a focus on dICO use cases (including the ongoing Bitcoin Hush dICO).

Both developers have reported they believe they will be able to implement this feature into their apps. This will allow users to send their funds in a manner optimized for atomic swaps. Users can opt to send this funding back to the same wallet address, completing their UTXO prep within a single BarterDEX GUI app.

This is the main level of automation the Komodo team currently intends to offer. We have considered creating a fully automated feature for the entire UTXO-creation process, but for the time being, our tests show that this ends up removing too much control from the user.

There are users familiar with programming who are developing their own personal systems for fully automated UTXO management. It is possible that our open-source community could work together to provide community-driven solutions in this regard.


Otherwise, users can simply continue to manually indicate their desire level of UTXOs when sending funds, as a part of the non-automated management process.

Jake0024,"If they said they have 1 USD for every 1 USDT they're being stupid and obviously wrong. They're also saying something they shouldn't have ever said, and had no good reason to ever say.

&gt; If they sell USTD for bitcoin, and then bitcoin falls below the price they paid, then they have less value (in USD) then they have on outstanding USDT.

They don't (even claim to) sell USDT for BTC. If you want to sell BTC for USDT, you give the BTC to another user on the exchange--not to Bitfinex. That other user must have paid for that BTC either in fiat, or the fiat equivalent of some other coin, and that's what you seem to be missing over and over. In exchange you receive USDT representing the current market value of that BTC.

Yes, not every coin is bought by fiat because prices do go up and down--that's why the market cap is not the same as the fiat value invested in the market. And as I said, this has always been true (of every single coin, regardless of whether Tether was involved or even existed yet) and is also true of the stock market.

This is not true. Bitcoin is a simpler scripting language, and so it is easier to do formal verification on it. Being a more free scripting language is not necessarily better. The first year of bitcoin's development was ripping out opcodes satoshi created that were too powerful.

As for proof of stake, if it works, it's going to work in Lightning. We've been hearing that PoS is months away for Ethereum for years now, believe it when you see it.

Bitcoin also has ASICs, which harden it against possible botnet attacks. The total stacked work in ethereum is much less than in bitcoin, making it more vulnerable to existing data centers.

Bitcoin just turned 9 years old, Ethereum is only 2 and a half.

Furthermore, bitcoin did not have a premine.",dtj8ktl,2,1/31/2018 13:42,,,,,,

FlamesRiseHigher,"&gt;""Samsung's foundry business is currently engaged in the manufacturing of crypto-currency mining chips,"" it said in a statement given to the BBC.

So they have a foundry working on producing chips, but they are not necessarily using them to build ASICs, but may just be selling them to ASIC companies, such as Bitmain.

So maybe not good for BTC, but maybe not bad for VTC as this won't be a solution to the ASIC centralization problem bitcoin faces.

Only time will tell if Samsung actually wants to go into the ASIC business.",dtj8kmz,2,1/31/2018 13:42,,,,,,

The Chair recognizes ed pa.

 A few of you mentioned development management, and it can depend on the circumstance, wop can one can be the option of principle positions and client positions if a default was for a clearing requirement.

So I guess the question is how do you think about the adequacy of and diversity of Claring members for giving product or a set of products?

It's true the default is that when a product goes live, it is live but it's probably also true that not 100 percent of your clearing members clear 100 percent of the products that are available on the various exchanges how do you think about the adequacy and the diversity of your clearing member set and whether they can support in a crisis?

  We looked at the default management, let me just say that it's not only the clearing member firms that we're looking at, it's also the by site participants.

If we're looking for auctioning off a book of a possible clearing member portfolio.

If we are looking for clearing members that could take on a portfolio, we're also looking at buy site con stithe apts who may have interest in taking on a portfolio.

So we engage in both of those.

We test extensively with our clearing members on default management test.

When we were looking at this product, we were interested in having a broad set of both clearing members that were looking to clear as well as buy site constituents that were looking to take on a portfolio so we know which ones today, that if we did have to liquidize or option off with Bitcoin we would know who to call or where to go to.  So that was an important point when we started talking about default management.

I say today, we have a number of clear  clearing members that are involved in of the Bitcoin market it's no longer a small market it's a number of clearing member firms so there is a diverse selection of different member firms that are participating in this market.

It's not concentrated into one or two firms.

We have had a similar situation to Dale it has been a diverse set and we are still continuing to see more clearing members come on and offer Bitcoin futures as this market has processed some by nature of the times of the launch for COE and CME said December is in the a good time for us we still have internal approvals to go through let's see how things play out we will talk again in January and that is definitely something that we are seeing in the diversity of members that are coming in.

Obtain the lickidation of that is key and default member procedures, testing and that is a key part of what we do for all of our contracts I always say with give ups, we appreciate the give up transaction, and are those agreements are very broad in nature, however it is written in our rules, that are any clearing member can reject a trade from any other firm that they are not willing to accept so that back stop has been there and is always part of our rules and applies to Bitcoin as well.

Well that concludes panel number three.

Before we break I would like to turn it over to the Chairman for closing remarks 

 Thank you Alisha, it's only my closing remarks you still have another panel, but I apology I have to go to another meeting and won't be able to attend that one.
We have two very proud traditions here at CFC and our commission really embrace roles as advisory committee sponsors and two that all of the commissioners actively participate in those meetings and stay as long as we're able and participate and actively listen, and I think today is the first advisory committee meeting of 2018, and the first one of the new commission.

I think you can see both of those traditions very much in effect and the tone of most organizations comes in we have a very good commission of staff here and most importantly a great turn out of advisory and dialogue.

I thank you and this is something we do well and we listen and hopefully that comes out as good policy moving forward.
We certainly take a lot from today and think of that and reflect back in due course.

So once again, I thank my fellow commissioners I know they're looking forward to your last panel and I look forward to  to hearing about it later on.

At this time we will take a ten minute break so please be back at 2:50.

WontFixMySwypeErrors,"Well the whole point of Bitcoin was that regular people could mine and maintain the network and nodes on their home computers, distributing the load to everyone instead of consolidating it in the hands of a few. Unfortunately SHA-256 is simple to do on a dedicated chip and this completely flipped the concept on it's head. Now mining is in the hands of a few who can afford all the specialized chips.

Altcoins that use asic-resistant algorithms are just basically correcting a flaw in Bitcoin.  So it's not the altcoins faults specifically...

FaiIedAbortion,"&gt;honestly give or take a couple years, I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see bitcoin legacy at all. the tech is too outdated and the fees/waiting time that comes with using the coin is terrible. I expect it to be used solely as an index coin and means of value or to enter the world of crypto. Bitcoin Cash will keep working its way up and replace Bitcoin Core eventually as a means of actual, usable currency.


So some people agreed/disagreed, then someone asked me to clarify why I believed the tech was outdated. so I said 

&gt;1. *Too slow* for practical, world-wide usage. The bitcoin network can only handle 7 transactions a section. That means only **7 people worldwide can buy or sell using bitcoin every second.** For comparison visa handles 24,000 transactions a second. 
(source: hackermoon.com)

&gt;2. High fees; 
&gt; Pretty explanatory. Transfer some BTC to a different exchange or send some to a friend and note the fee. Last time I transferred BTC the fee was 30% of the amount I was transferring... that‚Äôs more than a wire transfer. 

&gt;3. No privacy;  
&gt; Bitcoin wallets are tied to address hashes (random sequences of letters). Once the owner of a wallet is identified, all of their previous transactions and all of their future transactions are visible to anyone who downloads bitcoin‚Äôs ledger. This history can never be deleted or changed.

sensen88,I think it depends still on the amount they can back up. If their banks have 2 billion and there are 1.8 billion tethers then you might think is fine. BUT if they have being avoiding taxes then it becomes a problem. If the taxes owed are more than the difference then suddenly tether might not be completely backed by USD so it can become tricky. Not that it would make them insolvent but certainly the market can take a hit for this. I mean this market goes down and up because of a tweet so it can definitely hurt confidence. I personally dont think it should bring too much stirr in the long run but I did pull out initial investment because they are my biggest worry on the crypto community.

ACaulfield910,"I thought about that a few weeks ago, with the whole Bitcoin boom and everything. People were making the argument that Bitcoin isn't safe because its value isn't backed up anything. But if you think about it, neither is modern day money. It's just a value that we gave it. And we keep it fixed so that instead of changing the value of a dollar, we change the value of a product and say ""the money has no value"" or ""the money has more value."" Sure, there are a lot of factors that come into play, but the value is purely man-made, and not backed. Kind of mind-blowing.",dtj8anh,2,1/31/2018 13:38,,,,,,

Quivex,"Not the guy you were responding to but for me personally, I see the flippening as a good thing because it will take the eye of the public and mainstream media off of bitcoin and onto ethereum...That is (imo) important because most of the FUD spread in the MSM is often unique to bitcoin... ""mining uses more energy than 57 countries"", ""transferring bitcoin can take hours and cost hundreds in fees"" etc. Etc.  Many people stay away from crypto because they see all of crypto as bitcoin and bitcoin has so many limitations. The more attention ethereum gets, the more attention things like dapps, smart contracts and POS gets which is good for ethereum, and good for crypto as a whole. It will help inform the public about the true potential of cryptocurrencies instead of the ""wow look at this volatility bitcoin is a bubble"" that we have now...

Obviously this is a very optimistic scenario, but it's what I hope for if the flippening were to occur.

And I'm not saying bitcoin is bad or that it should die or anything, and I wish it the best and that it solves its problems...

- if crypto stabilizes and becomes widely accepted I think it would basically put credit card companies out of business, as businesses wouldn't have to pay what they pay to accept credit cards.

-i could put my Fiat currency into crypto for travel and not have to pay international exchange fees (some credit cards do this but not many, and you usually have to pay a yearly fee).

A guy my sister works with bought some bitcoin / litecoin a few years ago. He's not a tech guy at all... more of a bro (an admitted bro - he told me he's ""too stupid"" to understand any of this stuff). He's got this old laptop that he's running bitcore-core wallet and litecoin-core wallet. He needed help from me because both of his balances were 0. 
He had a piece of paper with keys written down - they were his public keys, unfortunately, AND they were written down wrong - so I couldn't even check the balances. The keys that were on his paper were different from the public keys in both the wallets. So he obviously at some point reinstalled the wallets or something. I asked him about this, he said his laptop was broke and brought it to Geek Squad at some point - they backed up his data and he got it back fresh. So he reinstalled the wallets and thought having his ""passwords"" written down would recover his wallets - these ""passwords"" were just the encryption passwords he made up to encrypt the wallets.

Sooooo..... gone. His coins, forever.

Then he told me he thinks he might have a backup of the GeekSquad backup on an online drive he uses. He gave me the login / password for the service he uses... 
.. I got in and did a quick search for ""wallet.dat"" and found two. One for bitcoin-core and one for litecoin-core.

Fast forward to me recovering his wallets... he has 0.444 BTC and 9.99 LTC.

 The Chair recognizes Biswar.
 Thank you for your remarks what I would like to point out is going back to the beginning and starting discussions about transparency and self certification in the process is the key to this things going smoothly and rebustly.

And I think commissioner, you mentioned following the process and what we do and not do, and as I hear your remarks from all three of you, it seems like you did -- do have a process in place and you use that process.

Chris, you mentioned about contract participants coming to you and asking you to launch this contract, Dale you mention about are discussion this extensively with the clearing members and risk committee and your board so to me, stepping back it seems like a process was in place and was followed but what I am taken aback in reconcile is if this was so long in the works and was discussed extensive with stakeholders, parties, why was there this adverse reaction to self certification of this product?

And this is probably another question to the rest of the MRAC as well, what are we doing wrong or what can we do better to make sure if a process is being followed and there are extensive discussions with the regulators, I certainly don't want more regulatory oversight and things that stamp out innovation, where is this gap and how did this gap arise?
The other way to frame it is if we did seek input from participants, are those participants not representative of the market based on the structure they're in?

 I'll start.
I think the first gap that I noticed.

First of all I was surprised by the focus on self certification, having gone through the process there was nothing I felt self certified about, we spent so much time working on the staff on this process, and I'm quite familiar with the FCC process and they don't have this concept of self certification and it was identical, it was identical until the very end in the nature of the filing, so I was surprised by the realistic to self certification.
I understood there was a great deal of focus on this Bitcoin topic, but one thing I did notice, and we have already heard it, the gap they noticed the most was the volatility of Bitcoin, the actual volatility of Bitcoin and the volatility that was reported in the press, that was the gap and people believed what was reported in the press and treated it as a toxic instrument and that's not what our members experienced in trading.
So I think the area, in retrospect in looking at how we ran our process, a great deal of our conversation were with the liquid providers and the end use errs, the market makers we did talk to FCMs but at the end of the process I would have flipped it to liquid providers -- I think we relied on the couchingss with the FCM that they cleared through and some of them didn't and that was probably the biggest problem with the press and the focus as well as the misinformation around the actual volatility of the product.


 Just to add on there -- I think it's a fair question.
I was seeing of the disconnect that I'm having is when we saw folks saying well it seems like it was rushed and I was sitting there looking back at it staying we started talking about this internal in of the fast half of 2017 and I brought this to our model working risk comprised of OCC risk management, the model validation, legal, compliance, we went through that process then went to risk committee, started in July, went back there in September.

We have talked about this in a number of different forums and when I felt rushed I don't know if I actually looked for at a new product than I did this one and then people say it was rush I think we need to be sure that we have the right folks on the forms that we reach out to.
And maybe it's a talk with each of the different clearing members and whether the right forms are there to retch out and make sure they have proper participation.
Maybe try to circle around and see if there are any gaps there.


Just to add to that, I think it was, one when we looked at the financial market there was not a lot of volatility.
Bitcoins of the one that had volatility in it.

That was the one that was getting all the hype and I think what that prompted is different dialogues and the challenge is with some of the end users that were asking for this product issue certainly at the FCMs, you couldn't be speaking with one voice in talking to a firm, because there would be difference of opinions even within the firm and so I do think it's a good point of saying making sure that we are talking across the firm, to various aspects not just the business, or the operations or the clearing risk folks, because even sometimes within those same groups they had different opinions.
The other difference they noticed is typically at launch, we are ready to all of our clearing members for a product launch and in this particular case we still don't want  don't have all our clearing members in our approach.

Many were seeing things on the news and witnessing every day and that process is still playing itself out as well.
But we were in a position to say we're not going to launch until we believe that we have enough participation from our firms as well as our end users and we felt we got that towards launch but I do think it's certainly pays acute attention who we're talking to and the diversity of opinions that were solicited 

 We're just going to take two questions.

I don't agree with CSW's position on IP, but that said I don't consider nChain's IP a threat in the least. It will benefit Bitcoin BCH.

Bitcoin BCH is a base protocol that exists without the need for a centralized standards body or a government authority.

In the existing paradigm, standards are set by industry bodies. They use the current legal framework to keep them functional. In this environment to remain relevant, you need a treasure trove of IP, and to have a say you need leverage in what could be considered a meritocracy with IP.  

Bitcoin Cash just needs to avoid incorporating or depending on proprietary IP on the base protocol. Industry and the IP they create is deployed on layers above base protocol. You can choose to use it or not. 

Blockstream were supporting a position that forced users to abandon the base protocol and use a layer two solution. Blockstream I imagine were patenting technology that enabled layer two solutions.

I cant imagine nChain being a threat, as they cant patent any of the ideas that are in the public domain. They don't (at least not yet) employ protocol developers, and we have no obligation to incorporate proprietary technology in a protocol that is outside of any jurisdictional authority. 

If nChain make useful things that BCH centric companies can use without a license this is a good thing. Even if the license holder wants to extract rent, it can not extract more than the free market is willing to pay. 

Leveraging the existing legal framework to make BCH stronger will ultimately undermine that authority as it is enabled by centralized control funded by fiat. Bitcoin and smart property is going to change everything.

Obama could have gotten economic reform passed, this is true but there was the stimulus package, which I still think was done incorrectly, and he was on it about health care, the biggest reason for bankruptcy (or in other words an excellent way to rid the economy of possible profit producing consumers). So there is that. 

When you say we should have seen 3% growth, you say this based on what? I'm genuinely curious. Why should our GDP be above 3% so soon after a global financial crisis? I understand things are low so the opportunity is there but why has every person who defends Trump say that we should have had over 3% GDP? What factors into this? 

I will not speak on the legislation that was passed recently because I am not a fortune teller so we will see how that goes. With that said, since Trumps legislation has yet to go into effect, would you not then say what we are seeing today is in fact the continued left overs from the previous administration? 

If not why is this not so? What specifically did Trump do to get things to where we are today? And not just he's getting rid of regulations either. I want you to tell me he got rid of x so that y could happen which resulted in z.

For example, Obama passed the stimulus package (x) , which gave money to corporations (y) that allowed them to remain open long enough to survive the housing market crash (z).

The Chair recognizes Thomas -- 
 I am curious about convergence, the CME and long standing process they go through to review the data and make changes.
I am curious on the newer products, two questions, are there different metrics you use on the different contracts on the underlying contract.
And when you are cash analyzing within the index, is there any -- in the index.

 I would say there are some differences between how the review of the physically delivered contract works, and how an index based cash settled product works.
In the case of the Bitcoin futures, our market surveillance team is watching that index every single day.

We are getting all of the constituent data for that reference price and the reference price is published every day in London, and that's our time to look for anomalies whether there may be a large trade that came in from one particular constituent exchange our methodology is published and in doing so we make it very clear what types of tradess we will include as part of that reference.

And making sure while we are using four different exchanges currently for that reference rate, there are obviously hundreds of other spot platforms out there today so part of the role of market surveillance and I know the CFTC is doing this also is monitoring what else is going on on those different platforms and daycaring taking all data into account.

It's similar to what we do with our products taking one TRA as a settle price, but there is another contract that offer it is, we are constantly analyzing that data to make sure we have price convergence and Dale mentioned arm  earlier, we are starting to see a narrowing basis between the futures markets and the cash markets we obviously look at that closely too and as we move towards expiration, all of that just gets heightened.

Frequent conversations with CFT staff, around these issues, just to ensure everything runs smoothly, because that con vengeance vergenes, whether it is a contract settled that's the whole concept and key aspect to any product design. 

 I'll just add we have slightly different product ours relies on an auction we call Gemini and we monitor that market and have extensive regulatory information with Gemini so we see behavior in both market and then we settle against an auction e vent.

Our most recent settlement occurred and what we do is we bound that settlement price by an index so not only do we have an auction, but we make sure that auction is correctly based on an index to the CME and the settlement was from our advantage point quite successful to converting to that cash price.

 Thank you.

With respect to the underlying markets with Crist owe currency, when you are talking about new product and product development, where you have a distributed fine of ledger currency or commodity that really has no regulatory construct and the protocols associated with the underlying commodity can be changed and modified in the hard where you have Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash going into two essentially underlying products but you have a derivative contract on top of that, how do you think about that in the nature of differences between that and other commodities such as the natural gas and the power contracts, where the underlying market is regulated do you have different regulators looking at the different markets themselves and the content can't be changed itself like that are if there is not a split between the market participants?


 We spent a great deal of time with the staff of the CFDC on that exact issue.

They were very focused on that issue early in the process, that was a discussion.

We all have fork policies around our products how do we determine for there is a fork and the analogy we used, the currency market and currency futures, the currency market is generally unregulate the and governments can change that at whims we spent -- and it's in our product specks, we did have to file fourth policy and what we did with those, the key is with information sharing getting information from the various crypto market and having sharing agreement in place and that's something the CFDC staff asked for all of us to do.

 I think of maybe a few different examples that might be relevant here, certainly there is a lot of novel aspects of the virtual currency market, but there are also other contracts that have been introduced and also self certified in past years.

One of them that comes to implied is mind is the  of the eh missions market, are created by a government mandate, and you know there were similar to hard fork, there are different vintages of those contract that get created and with legislation changes and positions changing we had to be in a position that our contracts could adapt to those.

Similar to the EPA changing the R Bob contract, for us launching the product is really just the beginning as we said this morning, we constantly have to evolve and make sure we are performing contract maintenance and designed a contract that enables that type of flexibility to be introduced, and evolves as the underlying market evolves and I think the other parallel with the emissions market, some may recall there are similar things where people are hacking into these registries and stealing credits.

Again it didn't make those markets go away.

They were still very active futures markets that existed on them, and the obligation of the DCMs and the DCOs were to monitor the risk and ensure that we were meeting our regulatory requirements which we were doing.

Sorry but your logic blows: if you could immediately replace it, why wouldn't you have just bought more in the first place?

It's like saying ""OK, buy $10 of bitcoin, and spend it, but then immediately rebuy $10 of bitcoin.""

If you had $20, why didn't you just buy $20 of bitcoin and use 1/2 of it on your transaction?

In all of bitcoins history the current price was still ATH for it's life aside from December and January. That's 2 months in its 108 month lifetime. 

So aside from those two months the correct answer would have been buy 100% of the bitcoin you could afford, if you had done that since 2009 you'd be very well off right now.

It is not more convenient, but with more adoption and technology incoming, it will soon be a cheaper + more resilient / less capitalist shitmongering than any other option. 

Steam removed it due to the transaction bullshit from the dust attacks. This is because it wasn't transparent to them. Resolve that with lightning and ta-dah, there is 0 reason to not accept crypto anymore. 

Which is why payment companies are adopting bitcoin, they know that they're going to be obsolete as soon as crypto enables instant, fee-less and trust-less transfers.

Drawbacks: its leadership is much more centralized, the supply is not fixed, it's not as private, and it's not been around as long to prove itself. I honestly don't think any of these things is a dealbreaker. It's still decentralized and would survive without leadership; inflation will be minimal, and perhaps completely negligible after POS is implemented; If you want privacy, bitcoin doesn't have an advantage over true privacy coins like Monero.

Overall, I think Ethereum has a much better case for being the superior technology. Only if centralization or deflation is your #1 criterion would you choose bitcoin.

bobnestal,"Thanks for the guide, very useful. Having read it and other articles this is my plan for claiming Bitcoin Gold (and other forks) and I' be grateful for any comments / corrections. I'm not a complete beginner but I've never claimed forked coins before.

- At the time of the fork my Bitcoins were in Jaxx along with several other coins. It seems the whole wallet is based on the single Jaxx backup phrase (which is in effect the wallet seed / master public key?) so I should move all my coins out of the wallet first, not just the Bitcoin? Jaxx only allows 1 wallet so I'd have to move them to another wallet / exchange.

- Then I can import (sweep?) the Bitcoin keys from Jaxx into my (new) Coinomi account using their instructions, and claim the Bitcoin Gold.  Does this involve transaction fees?

- To enable me to also claim Bitcoin Diamond once it starts trading, do I have to keep the empty Jaxx wallet open because my Bitcoin were there at the time of that fork? Or is it sufficient to keep paper copies of the keys and backup phrase? In which case could I uninstall and reinstall Jaxx, which would presumably give me a new backup phrase (wallet seed) and enable me to use Jaxx again?

- Subject to the previous point, I assume I can also sell some or all of my Bitcoin and it'd make no difference to claiming Bitcoin Diamond, or any other coin which forks prior to the date I sell?

lcvella,"Well, Japan had a deflationary currency for decades. When years ago I asked what were the tangible bad consequences measured due to deflation, this is the answer I got: https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/10483/what-are-the-consequences-of-deflation-in-japan

This is what I suspect to be true: since modern economics is founded more on ego and ideologically charged argumentations than on actual empirically verifiable science, probably someone in a not so distant past made up the argument that deflation is bad because such and such, and since it fit perfectly into the central banking system agenda, it has been repeated ad nauseum since then.

EDIT: Anyway, regardless of what is better, macroeconomically speeking, we will have to accept deflationary as the norm in the years to come, as Bitcoin breached the government maintained financial blockade, there is actually little any democratic government can do to impede willing people to just hodl instead of invest in the economy. In a global adoption scenario (next 1 or 2 generations reaching adulthood), any fiat currency that fail to to keep its value in face of Bitcoin (thus, being deflationary as well), will quickly fall into hyperinflation, as too many people will keep just enough for the immediate expenses in fiat.

I believe long term consequence of Bitcoin is forcing fiat currencies into deflation, for any that doesn't comply will be destroyed.",dtj6ugh,2,1/31/2018 13:15,,,,,,

fruitsofknowledge,"It might make it clearer that it's Bitcoin, but the stored information still doesn't change the actual time line. 

It's also rather unnecessary to bicker about who forked and when. The ""longest chain"" was a reference used in the whitepaper that didn't take this sort of a situation into account. It merely talked about an attacker finding it computationally impractical to reverse the transactions before it. The longest chain can no longer accurately be called Bitcoin if the nodes on the network are no longer ""honest"" in the objective sense of adhering to the design.

This above is a controversial point to make, but ""Bitcoin"" could fail and that is the only way it could do so in an absolute sense.

DrKobbe,"A Sybil attack means you own/represent more than one peer in the network. Depending on the purpose of the network, that may have different impacts. Two examples: 

* Bitcoin: miners validate the transactions on the network and add them to the blockchain. In theory, any malicious miner can falsify a transaction, but it will not be recognized by the rest. If someone owned &gt;50% of the mining power, he can outperform all other miners and completely validate his own falsified record of transactions.

* TOR: your traffic is routed in a few steps through onion routers. Each router only knows the previous step and the next step, and never the whole begin to end route. If someone owned a big portion of all onion routers, there is a bigger chance he owns multiple steps on your route. This would allow him to reconstruct the whole route and trace the traffic.

&gt; Dude, Ethereum has already had a hacking story and it still is going strong although not the type of hacking you assume. The price will drop, but it will never reach 0, it will be similar to Bitcoin when the Mt. Gox hacking scandal existed a few years back. 
&gt; 
&gt; And other coins like Ripple will grow. What allows a coin to succeed is not it's worth though, but it's adoption and usage rate. Ease of usage, Predictability and fast transactions, are what is needed for a coin to succeed.

hassitt,"The entire move looks artificially created by botfinex (as other users have pointed out in the past), if you look at the quantities of coins purchased at the time the uptrend started they're all roughly in the same ball park which to me seems fake bot demand. To be fair, it could also be that a load of algorithmic traders orders kicked in at a certain price but why would they all have roughly the same order quantity? That story doesn't fit unless there's a group of traders that want to control the price of this coin. Bitfinex have admitted that they use wash trading in certain situations, see here for more on that:
https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/wash-trading-bitcoin-how-bitfinex-benefits-from-fraudulent-trading-8bd66be73215

My guess is that bitfinex are trying to generate interest in the coin by kick starting it while every other coin is in the red. Perhaps they're holding too much of this coin, maybe they bought it at a bad price.

The sooner this coin is available on other exchanges, the sooner it can realise its true value. IMHO right now the price is swimming in a pool of artificial supply &amp; demand created by algorithms that do not reflect on the team, the idea or the potential of the project. 

One other thing worth considering is this, if other exchanges intend on offering streamr would they have to buy the coin via Bitfinex? Could these orders be generated by the accounts of other exchanges that will offer streamr in the future?

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions where you will have my full attention for the duration of your session. Unless otherwise negotiated I will start clothed and strip throughout the session, showing myself off, and interacting with whatever content you decide to send me. Once the session has started I will not pause or delay the session for any reason. While I'm open to suggestions and requests during your session, I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate our agreement without refund and may result in being banned on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on kik or Snapchat but it is my preference to use kik and it allows you to have the conversation for later use üòâ

Snapchat subscriptions give access to my private story which will contain nudes (picture and video) as well as a variety of other real life and SFW updates. This may include: nudes, teasing, public exposure, day to day check-ins, boy/girl content, early access to sales, updates on pre-made videos! I have been having a wild time and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day. For premium subscribers and only at my discretion I will open any content sent to me although I reserve the right to respond. I prefer to receive pictures of you smoking, chilling with your pets, doing something exciting, and **NOT** NSFW content. This does NOT include any guaranteed interaction and buyers should not purchase a snapchat subscription with the expectation of having daily chat.

&gt; Bitcoin has much greater security, as there is more mining support and infrastructure behind it. But the tradeoff is time: Bitcoin transactions tend to take longer than Bitcoin Cash transactions to be confirmed.¬†

These paragraphs read as total FUD (except that last sentence obviously). There is no mechanism in BCH which makes rejecting transactions easier, and the ""fewer wallets and exchanges"" is **barely** true if at all.

Even the ""greater security"" is a tough sell, both coins use the exact same infrastructure so the division of hashpower between the two is almost meaningless as the vast majority of miners **will** actively mine BCH and have every reason to defend it just as much as BTC.",dtj52h5,2,1/31/2018 12:47,,,,,,

‚Äòhello my dears! i‚Äôm a little teeny tiny 4‚Ä?1 and 103lb package of sugary sweet Latina fun!

In my free time, i‚Äôm playing with my adorable old lady boxer, Lucy Goose, and binge watching everything from Game of Thrones to Voltron to How I Met your Mother. i‚Äôm very laid back and just wanna have a good time! i talk a lot and love to give advice and just be an all around good person to everyone.

Feeling generous or wanna see me in something cute? Check out my amazon [wish list](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/29KOSAGK5QHLM). A good rule of thumb is I‚Äôm nearly always the smallest size in everything! And a size 6 shoe. And I love chokers. And Nine West. And puma. And mother of pearl everything. And Ralph Lauren everything! And pea coats! And the colors black, gray, taupe, white and maroon in clothing/shoes. And turquoise and pink are my favorite colors! And anything related to ASOIAF! Team Targaryen. And Ash vs. the evil dead/evil dead movies. And boxers (dogs) and greyhounds. And (fruit)bats are my favorite animals. And ancient Roman history (third servile war is my favorite story of the time). also super interested in Greek philosophy, Michio kaku, the
Cosmos, theories of life and mythology. And the talking heads are like my fave. Ever. I love to role play. And I love making others happy and being a therapist and giving advice. Not to sound like an Oprah moment but I really do love just building up others and helping them see themselves thru my eyes. So many folk had just one (or more) asshole in their life make them feel inadequate - been there, done that - and I just want to help people see that... you are worth it. And deserve love. And to live in the moment and embrace your sexuality - as lame as it sounds we really only do live once. So let‚Äôs have some fun together... ‚ù§Ô∏è

FalcoLamborghini,"&gt;Going from $160 billion to $13 trillion is another. If bitcoin were worth that much, then it'd be an asset class that take up 2/3 the space that **US treasuries** take up. That's unfathomable even if Bitcoin had no competition.

It's a good thing that Bitcoin is planetary and not just for the United States.

How much is 13 trillion relative to all the money on planet earth? &lt;-- That is Bitcoin's question. 

To give you a round about answer, 13 trillion would be about 5% and we're currently not even close to that yet since were only at 160 billion which is .06%.... (not even 1% yet).

The U.S is just 1 tree (a very big tree) in a pretty massive forest.

XxEnigmaticxX,"now forgive me if im wrong here since its been ages since i looked into ether, but from my understanding doesnt the ethereum blockchain based on contracts? 

from their white paper

""What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create ""contracts"" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.""

so it seems the core system of ethereum is contracts.a contract being hacked due to human error and then rolling back their block chain to recover funds that were stolen, to me at least, is far different then bad BTC code that enabled a bad actor to create coins out of existence. 

in btc's case, many exchanges have been hacked, but never once (that im aware of) has a blockchain rollback happened to recover funds. 

thats the big difference for me. the rollback that happened with btc is fundamentally different because it enabled the rules of bitcoin to no longer matter, while the rollback of eth was done because a 3rd party contract was hacked and people wanted their money back. 
",dtj4wjl,2,1/31/2018 12:45,,,,,,
RobertAZiimmerman,"Correct.  And that is the weakness of the whole system.

There is no cryptocurrency ecosystem at the present time.  People talk about Bitcoin or Ripple or whatever, in terms of *how many dollars it is worth* because no one accepts these currencies as payment.   The few that claim to do so, merely convert the crypto to local currencies and then use that money.   But fewer and fewer are willing to do that, as these currencies are so volatile that if you bought a car with Bitcoin today and they converted the currency tomorrow, the dealer could lose thousands of dollars in the transaction.

So everyone keeps their crypto on an ""exchange"" with a username and password, and these can be hacked through traditional means, including the oldest in the book - phishing.

And I suspect these highly publicized ""hacks"" are just that - idiots who invest in crypto (being redundant here) give away their username and password to a phishing e-mail.

And unlike traditional banks, these exchanges don't have checks and balances in place to prevent someone from quickly draining your account.

But like I said, until one of these cryptos develops its own sealed ecosystem - where people are buying and selling with the crypto and NOT merely converting dollars or other local currencies into crypto and back again - it will never take off, other than as a means for people to transfer money for illegal purposes or to launder money.

And the latter is not a foundation for a ""currency"" of any sort.

The most important part of a crypto is to be censorship-resistant. Without that, you will be shut down. Just like what happened to BitGold. BG didnt have problems with scaling or stuff like that. They got regulated to death.

When VB can get the Ethereum community to roll back the chain, it shows a lack security from censorship compared to bitcoin because a govt or shady third party can apply pressure on VB.

It was a tradeoff. Security vs. flexibility. Time will tell whether Ethereum, Bitcoin or some other coin gets it most right, but youre not portraying the issue fairly.

Schrodingers_tombola," This is the CRIX, it is a pure index tracker, just so you can look it over (not a fund at all, there's no buying it, I think, though I suppose in the future it may be able to be recreated on Iconomi).   
http://crix.hu-berlin.de/#services  

To answer your point on weighting, I don't see that SCX is less arbitrary than BLX. As a flat rate, it is probably more arbitrary.   
BLX is weighted by a logarithm of market cap. I have no idea if that is a usual approach taken in creating funds. 

As to whether bigger projects are harder to be brought down one thing that is worth considering is that if ETH fails, the erc-20's will also fail. ETH and Erc-20's comprise 45% of SCX, and 40ish% BLX. Not much difference really. If Bitcoin fails, as well as ETH, I have no idea what the market would do, and I don't think any level of fund management would help.

Another is that as SCX holds the top of the market-cap coins. These generally are platforms or currency coins which already perform the task they are able to do, and are basically fully formed. This is the area they want the fund to cover. They will change the fund over time depending on which cryptos emerge as market leaders, as far as I can see from their description. I think they'll be a little more active about it than BLX, but I wouldn't expect BLX to lag too far behind responding to major shifts in the high-end market. Equally, BLX has more projects that are function-oriented which would be unlikely to ever reach lead the market, even if they increase in price. ",dtj4klk,2,1/31/2018 12:40,,,,,,

lurgi,"&gt; Absolutely false. ""Satoshi's Vision"" might require decentralization, but the technology can be used in many different ways. It doesn't have to be used in a particular way.

The point that I keep making and you keep ignoring is that the problem of a *centralized* ledger is easy, already solved many times over in many different ways, and doesn't need a blockchain.

&gt; The point is to easily erase the impact someone like Donald Trump makes. For instance, if agree that the government that existed after he was elected should not have existed, we roll back everything that was signed into law since. The things we want to keep are reapplied. Makes it easier to point to a specific block you want to roll back to

If you want git you know where to find it. Plus NO GOVERNMENT ON EARTH WANTS TO WORK THIS WAY. You are coming up with a solution that no-one wants to a problem that doesn't exist, just so you can use your pet technology even if there are other alternatives. There is no legal framework for saying ""All laws passed since 1/20/2017 are invalid"" and *if* you did want that you'd pass a law saying ""All laws passed since 1/20/2017 are invalid"". Done.

&gt; Look at how DPos works in a system like Lisk or Decred, and tell me how you could implement a system where people can be voted in or out of office in real time that is more efficient.

Which assumes I want this. And I don't see why a decentralized system is necessary here. What *value* does it bring? In the case of bitcoin, well, I think bitcoin is crazy, but it's clear to me and to everyone who has read the original paper that the blockchain actually solves a very particular problem and that other solutions won't work because of the constraints of the problem. For the case of bitcoin it is *necessary* that the ledger be decentralized, so the blockchain adds very obvious value (it makes the problem solvable). If you don't need a decentralized ledger, however, there is no reason to add one. The blockchain adds complication, so you would normally only use it when it is necessary.",dtj4dam,2,1/31/2018 12:37,,,,,,

u/tippr 2$

&gt; it is likely that Tether is run just like fractional banking

Their own legal page says they are not redeemable.

This means that unlike with scammy fractional banking here there is not even a *promise* of redemption.

Literal monopoly money.

So why did people use it and buy it? 1. To move ""money"" more easily and 2. Because they did zero research.

&gt; The problem with this is when you inject such a large amount of currency into a closed system, it creates what is called velocity. I believe this is exactly what we saw here recently with the hyper inflation of Bitcoin.

Somewhat true, but not a huge problem as Tether is ""only"" 2 billion dollars in a 500+ billion dollar market.

The crypto revolution is real and value has always been fluctuating wildly.

The best way to use crypto currency is to only hold amounts you can afford to lose and to *use* it to free yourself - in as you say for example a divorce.. or just paying a friend for beer.

Using crypto also doesn't exclude gold, bullets and stocks!

&gt; Almost every exchange will be demanding you jump through a lot of hoops to verify your identity. After that, every wallet you will ever use with that exchange can be tied to you

For two, this is not a USA thing, but a worldwide thing. As such it can plausibly exceed in value any single local thing out there.

For three, value is derived from usage and utility. So far Bitcoin is barely used on the worldwide scale, less than 0.00001% of all transactions are done in Bitcoin. Get it a million times more popular, and it can easily grow 10 or 100 times more.

If it proves legally viable in many years, after some legal precedence are set and it becomes the common use, I might consider using something like it for practicality, aside from my bitcoin holding or stake in the dollar - but as it stands it's just all risk and no reward and I think that should be pointed out to people.",dtj48mf,2,1/31/2018 12:34,,,,,,

My current hope is we see a long correction in the market, similar to what we saw from Bitcoin in 2014. Once things stabilize a bit and the general public forgets about crypto again, I'll pile up and wait for the next surge. This of course, is my selfish side talking. 

Overall I really hope for long term success for crypto and blockchain tech as a whole. I just hope I can make some money during the process. Maybe this way of thinking is also a hurdle for crypto.

The Lindy effect is a concept that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy. Where the Lindy effect applies, mortality rate decreases with time. In contrast, living creatures and mechanical things follow a bathtub curve where, after ""childhood"", the mortality rate increases with time. Because life expectancy is probabilistically derived, a thing may become extinct before its ""expected"" survival.

Turtlecupcakes,"This doesn't really impact the security of Bitcoin, as long as your keys are safe, so are your coins - that hasn't changed.

It's true that anonymity is impacted but Bitcoin never promised to be truly anonymous. By design, every single transaction and balance is public and anonymous. You give up some of that anonymity as soon as you make a transaction that ties your wallet address to your name and a record of that is kept - like when an exchange records your BTC deposits and withdrawals.

If you only ever transact in Bitcoin and only use aliases and VPN's to buy and sell, someone might be able to tie the aliases and wallets together, but your personal identity would remain anonymous.

Some of the newer cryptocurrencies (like Monero) have made design changes to guarantee greater anonymity for everyone.",dtj3gti,2,1/31/2018 12:23,,,,,,

Hexxys,"&gt; anyone can set up a link between his buddies and circumvent any hub.

Sure, but you need to perform an on-chain transaction to establish the connection, and another one to close it.  You cannot ""extract"" your Bitcoin until the connection is settled, so why wouldn't you just do an on-chain transaction in the first place?  This is the central question that caused Bitcoin to split into BTC and BCH.

Hubs make this process more efficient since you don't need to make a bunch of ad hoc connections to individuals, splitting your money further and further every time you make another new concurrent connection.

To your second point, yes, that's probably exactly what is going to happen.  You'll have large companies whose sole business model is to A.) have lots of money to put into connections to ensure liquidity and B.) make as many connections as possible, all in exchange for an access/processing fee.  That's pretty much what the banks/credit processing companies like Visa do already. 
 It might work well, but it's pretty much the opposite of what Bitcoin should be trying to accomplish.  In fact, the most ironic part about the LN is that the most efficient incarnation of it would be one central hub and everyone ""spoking"" out from it.  Your transactions would only ever require one hop and would be virtually guaranteed to go through almost instantly.  You could reach literally anyone with zero ad hoc connection opening/closing/settling, no stalled nodes, etc.",dtj3eri,2,1/31/2018 12:22,,,,,,

franklin_d_turtle,"awesome developments and great job on the partnership marketing efforts!! I think meetups will be a helpful tool to onboard business owners. 

I would highly recommend adding an email signup box at the top of the website page too so people can signup to for updates via email. Use mail chimp to collect the emails. 

I think the website needs a bit of work yet. In particular I would remove the various photos at the bottom, there are too many photos and this will slow down the webpage when loading in places with low bandwidth. This will also hurt the SEO ranking if the photos are not properly optimized. Do we own the copyrights to these photos too? Its wise to play it safe to build trust. Simple is always best for building trust. Although, the top part of the website looks great. Nice and clean. Something will need to be done with the accepted payment method logos too. I can see that getting messy really quickly. With the NYC photos at the bottom and the logos being updated frequently this could make the website super slow to load. There will be literally hundreds of images on that one page with the two photo banks combined.  

The reddit and twitter account header graphics needs some work too. We need a very clean and streamlined brand here to create trust. The current branding comes off as scammy. The usage of all caps in the twitter description is not well suited for trust either. Why are you yelling at me? This is what all CAPS portrays. Its also best not to associate with bitcoin. That is dangerous. What happens if the price collapses? will people lose faith in NYC too? NYC coin is its own brand despite being a bitcoin protocol token. ",dtj3c30,2,1/31/2018 12:21,,,,,,

BootyPoppinPanda,"Can someone please address the following issues here: asking for /u/JustSomeBadAdvice who has presented these concerns to me, but I don't have the knowledge to understand some of these concerns:

Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

* You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them. 
* If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with. 
* The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs. 
* Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay each other without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs. 
* Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost. 
* The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable. 
* Hubs will only be based in developing nations. KYC requirements will close down any successful hubs in developed nations 
* Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available). 
* Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions. 
* Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins. 
* Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves. 
* The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available) 

And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

* Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used. 
* Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users. 
* Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks. 

I'm not of the opinion that lighting is WORTHLESS... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.",dtj3azh,2,1/31/2018 12:20,,,,,,

i_am_archimedes,"&gt;Nothing is priced in Bitcoin

except for the bitcoin network transaction fees

&gt;Bitcoin never will be a currency because it is not stable enough

this is as stupid as saying ""bitcoin will never be stable""

&gt;A restaurant is not pricing its stuff in bitcoin when the purchasing power of bitcoin can change drastically every day.

[why do people with intellectual disabilities post so much on the internet?](http://bitcoinrestaurants.net/)

&gt;And before you tell me bitcoin price will stabilize enough to be a currency, give me a break.

pottedmeat7,"""the money itself knows when to release when a contract is complete and to who. You cannot do this with real money, real money does not have any in built mechanism to do it""
Crypto-currency does not have a built in system to release itself, it takes another system a ""smart"" contract. Just as another system can be created to automatically charge from paypal. 

""I can't say to someone right heres ¬£50 ill put it here, you complete X work and that will auto get sent to you"" Yes you completley can. Also its not really a problem as real work would take non ""automatic"" means of verification. Crypto-currency cant really ""automatically"" verifiy anything other then electricy computed so its really not a solution to guarantee anything productive was actually done. I would think any person building or designed a ""blockchain"" platform will understand and realize this obvious problem, thus displaying the complete inadequate idea of a ""blockchain"" platform.

Im not close minded, I see with open eyes, and an open mind that the blockchains use is convoluted and is being mostly pushed by very confused greedy online people who dont understand the larger picture of ""work"" outside of blogging or leaving their computer on all day for a quick easy buck.

Its not just unstable at the moment. Its unstable by design. Its known that the value of crypto-currency comes from how much complexity it would be to solve for a coin. This leads to a multitude of new problems that normal currency does not experience. A never ending struggle to have more resources dedicated to generating money, which is essentially a more and more wasteful use of resources. There is a limited amount of bitcoin that can be generated also a new problem. Once its all done, who has the money? Are they the king of the world now? Or maybe we start all over and make up a new form of money, again, and so on and so on? When all of that could be avoided now. 

First let me state some definitions, a public ledger which is simply just open distributed closed data and a public ledger that is computationally generated such as what it takes for bitcoins public ledger, there a multiple types of ""public ledgers"" so what follows is for a bitcoin style public ledger, meaning anyone can attempt to change it, and if they can its perfectly fine and they are actually rewarded.

A public ledger is not needed, simply a ledger which I can make as many duplicates as I feel as I need to legally back me in case the only other authority, the bank, for some reason decides to maliciously alter it. This isn't something that is likely to happen, nor is it even considered an actual problem in reality. 

The best use case for a public ledger is monetary transactions. Which as stated above its use is overstated and not really solving a significant real problem. Thats the best use case for a public ledger. Other use cases are even more irrational solutions to insignificant problems. A public ledger is a very large structure of transactions that would certainly be more efficient to store privately between two parties, If strong forms of verification are happening then theres no logical (non paranoid dilusional, sci-fi movie) reason to believe that anything else is needed. Systems such as voting may sound like it would be good for a public ledger, however because a public ledger like bitcoins actually is computationaly generated allowing for whom ever to affect it depnding on how much they can compute it simply cannot be run on a blockchain system like that, meaning you would have to limit the amount of ""computation"" allowed per citizen, something that is completley the opposite of what a blockchain system relies upon. A public ledger, not on the blockchain, for voting may be good the technology running it however should not be the blockchain, Ie it shouldn't be left up to computation. Instead simply every citizen can generate a single strong private key along with however many forms of physical authentication they'd prefer and they get 1 vote. Sure the results could be publicized. 

Also crypto-currency is not necessarily safer then standard currency, as it already has known vulnerabilities as well as with these new systems, that don't use the proven standard blockchain technolgy that bitcoin uses, will inevitibly introduce more and more as well as a struggle to get the obvious 51%. Current currency can be encrypted and verfied just as much as crypto-currency, meaning a transaction will only happen if you verfiied it and there wont be a way to use a CC number that changes every 10min thats encrypted with 2048 encryption so you cant know what it is (solved.), it also could be backed by multiple layers of security and agencies, ensuring proper dealings, such as ensuring you actually got the package, which is the actual problem.

""flaws are already fixed with different coins"" They fixed some problems introduced other problems, and this is exactly what they know. As bitcoin is currently the best of this technology, it is the best system with these least amount of vulerabilities. It doesn't have many vulerabilities but it does have a few. Other will inevitibly have more as there are not as well founded on the actual mathematics that were original introduced and released as blockchain technology by Satoshi Nakamoto. As there are a million different combinations of systems that can have any number of vulerabilities that obviusly can happen, I think a proven standard backed system such as USD with stronger and smarter levels of protection for CC numbers and online transactions is the best solution. 

""This will always be the case with banks and they will always charge for the process"" Banks can operate as quickly and as efficiently as they see fit, it could completley change. It would take more communication with some of these other governments to ensure progressive and productive uses and benefits for allowing this simple trade, just as its a benefit for the US to trade to the UK. However some of these countries have much more serious real world problems. Ensuring that a transaction wont instead fund a kidnapping ring or drug lords or allow for more and more corrupt sydicates more and more money, is a burecratic problem for the country and the bank that have all the information on how trading money will be used. Only after the real world problems with these local communities being run by violence greed and inequality due to desperate poverty or confusion can those countries truly benfit themselves and improve their lives. 

I don't know what video you are talking about that I watched. I simply watch the world of people that greedily want to leave their computers on all day make quick un-productive money, because they need more more more. Then the slough of suffocating yuppies try to act like whatever they are doing is the most important thing in the world, and how they are ""helping"" the world with blatant claims that it will help the impoverished even though it requires spending all of your time online being a stock broker and not spending your time lugging buckets of water up and down a hill or clearing out the raw sewage from away your house. The spread of more and more convuluted systems that have substaintial flaws and in-efficiencies and vulerabilities. 

Im not just saying we don't need something, I look at what it does, analyze what people are saying, think about the use cases apply a multiple perspectives as well as long term view, then weigh the outcome. In all sensible practices ""the blockchain"" is not useful. The planned use is nothing more then replacing FastTrack or Paper Contracts. ",dtj2zvf,2,1/31/2018 12:15,,,,,,

johnstarks13,"I invest in plenty of things I wouldn't or don't use.  I own shares of Apple, but I don't own any Apple devices.  I just acknowledge than my use preference of the product or commodity may not equal those of others, and acknowledge it could still be a good investment.  I've also invested in things I have used that have gone belly-up - Palm stock is a good example.  I loved the Palm Pre way back when it came out.  I bought shares.  It failed.  Oops.

You don't need to use something to invest in it.  You should understand it, though, and sense where the market may head.  That's more important to investing than your personal use preferences.

To your specific example, there's a probability that the original Bitcoin is viewed as digital gold in 10 years.  People use it globally primarily to hedge against inflation and hedge out of government policy, not to transact.  Maybe you disagree.  Maybe you say sure, but BCH can do that, but also act as a better transaction medium.  Well, maybe the world decides it doesn't really care about transaction medium and more efficient transactional coins don't grab market share.  Who knows.

rackham15,"They expect it to continue to go up in price because it's deflationary, and people *do* use it. There are certain use cases that can only be achieved with a decentralized cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin is the market leader.

Short term fluctuations are caused by traders and panic sellers. Long term, we can expect the amount of holders, people losing it, etc. -- to increase, which will lower the supply. We can also expect bitcoin (or another crypto) to be used more, which will increase the demand.

Thus, it will continue to go up in value until it is displaced by another cryptocurrency, as the supply keeps going down, and the demand continues to go up. 

Simple economics make Bitcoin (or its replacement) an extremely good investment. That being said, most of these altcoins and ""tokens"" will meet disastrous ends. ",dtj2yuc,2,1/31/2018 12:15,,,,,,

cryptogrip,"Worried About Bitcoin?? Don't... Consider THIS:
Sure, we could provide some solid information to back up Bitcoin's value (9 years running and proven, immense amount of dollars worth of computer technology making up the entire blockchain, secure, etc.), but the fact is most of the value placed in Bitcoin is based on current hype, speculation and the hopes that it will be one day worth more than what it was purchased for.
Now, consider that in the past month, Bitcoin has received enough bad publicity to shut down and bankrupt some of the largest companies on the planet. Yet, it just keeps rising back from its beating. BAM, BAM BAM, and still ...it brushes itself off, and gets back up. 
Now if it's value is based on hype, then it's survived the worst type of hype there is. We're talking FUD over regulations, theft, criminal use, Facebook banning the ads, Warren Buffet and other investment experts bashing it, and the list goes on and on and on.
Now if it bounces back from this, imagine what it will do if the bad publicity eases off, or stops. When every rung in the ladder that it climbs  is not met with a steel toe boot to kick it back down. What about if it actually starts receiving a little positive news? Can you see where I'm going? Most of the negative articles are click bait and very biased, leaving out all traces of the positive store of value it has the potential to be.
Now add to this the fact that most young people prefer to invest in cryptocurrencies and are comfortable with their knowledge in it. Young people are by default tech savvy, and are the next generation to control the situation of tomorrow. 
Bitcoin is not down 10k, it's way up from last year. Many simply choose to look at it with a very small lens, and leave out the big picture. It happened to have a very famous peak at its ath of 20k along the way but it's far from finished with it's journey. NOTHING goes straight up folks. Something that endures this kind of a beating is not the kind of thing that stops easily. I say don't worry about Bitcoin, and certainly not about VEN and the other promising crypto based technologies.

nootropicat,"The answer is simple:  
technically, ethereum can do everything bitcoin can and does literally every single thing better. Development is rapid and concentrates first on fixing actual problems. 

On the adoption front it has 100% of the crypto stock market/ico sphere, a field once dominated by bitcoin. This field itself is rapidly growing as new business try to avoid stock markets due to excessive bureucracy. Adoption as a medium of exchange and as a store of value is exponentially increasing.  Thanks to turing complete contracts ethereum allows for 'permissionless innovation'. Really old ideas like MAST require years to get into bitcoin and it's unclear if it's ever going to happen. It could be implemented right now as a smart contract on ethereum without asking anybody for permission. 

All this directly translates into value of one ether, because after proof of stake goes live every ether becomes a share in the network. More adoption = more fees = higher income.

There are many other people involved. 

&gt;Mutable

Anything that requires a fork to change a transaction is not mutable by definition. Ripple or iota are mutable.

Daily transaction count has gone up about 22x. Network effects are nonlinear.

CubicEarth,"It is silly to seriously state that Bitcoin ""is not money"". Money is whatever people think it is and use as such. Things are priced in USD as a mater of convenience, but that can easily change. I agree that Bitcoin is not currently stable enough to be useful as a unit of account, but that almost certainly will change. It is a matter of the coins becoming more widely distributed, they technology maturing, and inflation rate (mining rewards) decreasing. There are countries out there who's currencies are less stable than Bitcoin, and that doesn't make it any less ""money"".

As far as things being priced in gold? That was basically the case right up until the USD went of the gold standard (at least for the USD). The big experiment has actually been the last 50 years, since we left the gold standard, and the results are open to debate.

I agree that many people are in Bitcoin for investment/speculation, but it is key to realize that it is not based on the greater fool theory. This technology has revolutionary potential. Bitcoin is absolutely the leading contender to become the first truly global currency, primarily because of network effects, both technological (installed codebase) and financial (deepest liquidity of any crypto coin(trust!)).

Sure, ""Buy the Dip"", ""All in"", and ""Hodl"" are pretty silly memes, but they are also about reinforcing a mindset and belief system. Belief is central to any money anyway, so it is not unreasonable.. ""In God we Trust"", etc etc.

Also, for Bitcoin to hit a high price of $20k, it is necessary for long term holders (like Loaded, with over 40k BTC), to not sell. It could be they are not selling for ideological reasons, but there are certainly other early adopters who are not selling at that price because they believe it will go much higher in the end. These are not clueless gamblers, these are people with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on the line who have spend thousands of hours thinking over and studying the fundamentals of the system, and concluding it and its growth prospects to be sound. Bitcoin hitting $20k is proof that this group of people is convinced it will go higher. So once that proof is attained, as it now has been, buying at $12k, at $10k, or $5k can been seen, in a sense, as a good deal. It could fail. But it's a binary outcome. HODL is about the necessity of people being detached from the current market valuation of the coin. Let's check back in 5 years when most websites (globally) that accept payment will be on the lightning network. Currency traders do buy the Yen or Rubies when they drop in value (below their fundamentals). But we all know that fiat currencies are not good long term investments. Bitcoin is challenging that paradigm by attempting to be a deflationary currency. It is a radical concept. It is understandable that people want exposure to the experiment.",dtj2erg,2,1/31/2018 12:06,,,,,,

 &gt;Hi,

&gt;Hoping that someone can offer some good advice please.

&gt;I'm interested in buying BitCoin/Ripple &amp; various CryptoCurrencies.

&gt;Totally new to it. 

&gt;I'm in the UK. Could someone tell me the best/safest place to buy CryptoCurrencies ( Including BitCoin &amp; Ripple XRP ) &amp; the safest place to keep them until I have bought a HardWare Wallet please. And which Online Wallets allow transfers ( Free or Cheapest ) from online Wallet to HardWare.

&gt;I'm buying a Ledger Nano S. But new ones aren't shipping until March 2018.

&gt;Thanks.

pcvcolin,"You really do never know what you are going to get.  I am something of a bitcoin maximalist (have been since 2009) but am open to other currencies.  As a result of a collaboration with one alt (BCN, which is the coin from which Monero was forked) which at the time, a few years ago, was 63rd or 65th on the crypto market cap list (it wasn't worth much at that time, relative to some other decentralized cryptosystems), I was able to get an idea integrated into BCN that at the time simply would not have been possible to have been integrated into bitcoin: small, but voluntary microdonations (as an option in the BCN graphical wallet, either from mining or just from transactions).  see http://abis.io for some details.  That was back in late 2015. (Today BCN is 28th on coinmarketcap, it usually has been ranging now somewhere between 20th and 25th, but the past couple days have been rough for all cryptos, though they will bounce back.)

In bitcoin, there was a bit of a waiting game for segwit to activate (now it's activated) and for lightning to become available (now there are hundreds of lightning nodes, though it is still in testing) both of which are preconditions before http://abis.io can be developed in a bitcoin wallet.  (See also a colleague's project (u/ktorn) - http://subsatoshi.org/ -- which will likely find eventual further development and application as lightning development proceeds.)  I think the voluntary microdonation concept envisioned originally and implemented in BCN can soon be developed in the form of a bitcoin GUI wallet that has that same feature.  

Interestingly, BCN and bitcoin have some of the same features now (bitcoin picked up some stuff that was originally present in BCN).  See:

1) https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures.html

and

The current GPU mining is no different than the story of bitcoin mining. At one point you could easily mine bitcoin with a CPU then the difficulty rose too high that it didn't get you anything. Then people moved to GPU and then that difficulty got too high to justify due to ASIC.

chrisgilesphoto,"I see a lot of people talking about a bubble pop but I have this feeling it's not, not now.

I guess 10k for anything is a lot of money. Note when LTC went up due to noobs on Coinbase being able 'to buy a lot more coins for less' and yeah, 10k for one thing (even if you can buy fragments) makes a difference.

If other coins weren't paired to Bitcoin I don't think they'd take a hit like they do when BTC dips and of course Ethereum is holding it's own. A lot of Alts are up in Satoshis, go to the 1day chart and see. Take Bitcoin out of the market calcs and it's nowhere near as bad as it looks.

If everything went to hell then yeah, I'd say pop. It's hard to do so when a lot of other things are doing well. The money is there, it's just not going into BTC.

My prediction in the future: Ether pairing and possibly if it works out with Tether, more USDT pairs. Maybe the divergence from BTC is already happening. Maybe it's not a pop, but a change in focus.

The Internet was created by the US military to be a resilient and decentralized network that can survive a nuclear attack....and it obviously became much more than that.

Bitcoin was created as a resilient and decentralized digital currency and worldwide payment system for peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary. That is still true today and it is expected to be much more than that. Actually, it is expected to become the foundation for the Internet of money.

&gt; BTC started out promising it's a currency, which it fails hard at.

You should elaborate how you see it fails...

Personally, I see a currency that has gained value year after year since his creation and has never been so much popular and talked about everywhere.

My guess is that what you are referring as a failure is related to the current state of the fees and the low speed of the transactions. The main goals of his creators was not to make it fast, cheap and highly scalable. It also never be expected that it will be as much used worldwide as it is right now. So yeah, the bitcoin network is currently overloaded with transaction at the moment. Fortunately, they are currently hundred of developers working full-time on the lightning network (bitcoin's 2nd layer). Basically, Lightning will be what the HTTP protocol is to TCP/IP. Lightning on top of Bitcoin will be able to process transaction instantly for incredibly low fees. It will also offer more private transactions and even the ability to make smart contracts among other things.

Can you give me some examples of those cryptos which don't have a company behind it or have another single point of failure? Besides that, what can those cryptos do better than bitcoin with upcoming upgrades like lightning, Rootstock, schnorr, mast, confidential transactions etc.?

Besides that you could also look up the history of other protokolls like TCP/IP or UDP which were developed 30-40 years ago and are still around. People are building layers on those protokolls exactly like bitcoin and its community will.

rakeshpatel1991,"Thank you for the detailed response. I dont do IT Professionally, but I know unix and windows admin stuff and built a ton of vmware clusters before. This will be my second-ish mining operation but the first one was in 2012-2013 with 290Xs but I just took a observatory role. This money is not mine, I have this very wealthy mentor who will invest in the crazy ideas I tell him about. So here I am! I am currently mining on everything but the HS110 BTC+. Basically the other stuff was my small POC before presenting it to him, and its all my own personal stuff, it was my gaming PC and homeserver before converting it. He is ok waiting 5+ years to get a return on his initial investment or never getting it back (my first warning was this). I think you have persuaded me to to do 6 per rig. so 2x6 because this rig will also be managed remotely and stability matters. I live across the country from where he is paying for space/power. 

* 
I am currently loving HiveOS, it works really well, but I am only at one rig so scale hasn't really been tested for me personally. In the telegram channel, people say they have long-term stability at 12+ cards with this board and hive.

It allows me to use one thing (less points of failure/complication) to power an entire rig (will be running at 220v). But what scares me is i have not seen this anywhere else on the web. What do you think?

Ah yeah i want to have a frame that can stack and is scalable so that I can replicate this as I get more GPUs. I have been thinking about [getting a weed grow tent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jo8AE17rKU). I could vent the hot air outside and allow the negative pressure of the ambient (ac'd) air in. I might have to use inlet fan, not sure yet. I havent seen any big time miners do this, So maybe this is just a short term solution.

And they all carry the correct name. Not BitcoinBTC or RippleXRP or something like that.

If Quoine actually cared they could easily put enough pressure on the admins of reddit to kick out the inactive troll keeping the r/QASH group as hostage. I tried my best to find a solution, from messaging him to contacting the admins. But Im just a random single guy, so I didnt come through.

Also I am getting really frustrated about the use of this subreddit as a marketing channel for their freaking exhange. I certainly didnt sign up for to be a cheerleader on QRYPTOS. And I know many here want updates on QASH. But there is absolutely nothing. For a team and a ICO getting over 100M dollars in their ICO round, you know they suck with marketing when they cant even get a simple update now and then on the project. Their Telegram channel which supposedly is for QASH contains nothing but news about new UI on their exhange or that the exhange have added this ICO and that ICO. It seems they are using the money the raised to boost their own exhange instead of they project itself. Atleast thats how it feels like.

Im about to abandon ship if this continues. Quoine got atleast 3 strong competitors sailing up ready to take over if Quoine continues this silent route. LiquidQASH is a bad name, and we should be at QASH instead of here

domelane,"&gt; The easy growth is over guys, you need to manage your expectations. Bitcoin produces no income, it just sits there, and you hope someone else pays more for it. You'd be better off investing in something that actually creates stuff and grows.

That's the exact same thing people said when it hit $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, then $1000, now over $10,000 and will continue to say at $100,000, $1000,000...Ôªøand so on.


Everybody parroting: ""The bitcoin bubble is about to pop"" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is exponential.
So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020, since it came from less than $1 to $10,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential 'S-Curve' of adoption. 

You need to look at exponential growth in technologies:

This.  I can see the potential for lightning to become ""centralized,"" but shit, my company builds a centralized solution for my clients.  It's just that with Bitcoin, the piece underneath is secured by distributed data and cryptography that gives zero fucks about the brand of suit you're wearing or how many houses you own.  Shit, even the piece *on top* (Lightning) is secured by honest crypto - no one can just run off with your shit, and rather than being forced into a single system of pre-established A.C.H.'s and payment processors, an Ubuntu server and a bit of bandwidth is all you need to play.

Crypt0Sauce,"Hello ""BobUltra"" 

I'm going to attempt to answer your worries and fears as professionally as possible. 

First - You claimed Trezarcoin is ""just a money grab from the founder and shill/ambassador"" 
  This is just simply not true. The coin and the community are very upfront about their work. You just have to get on 
  slack and ask them your questions.   Slack is currently the place where most of the Trezarcoin community hangs out. 

Secondly - You claimed your reason for your first comment was ""past performance"". 
I'm not sure what indicators you're using..Trezarcoin has only been around since Sept 2017 so really for you to use ""past performance"" as an indicator is nothing more than ignorance on your part.   Sure the road map has been delayed slightly - but the team has been upfront about it..They have nothing to hide.  Again...just get on slack and ask. 


Then you go on to talk about Bitconnect which was a scam...to compare bitConnect to Trezarcoin is slightly unfair but you didn't technically do that so hey ho. 

You also went on about ""unknown"" developers....90% of the developers in crypto are unknown or anonymous to some degreee. Crypto is all about privacy so I dont know why you're so upset about ""unknown"" developers.....the same could be said about Satoshi in the early days.   

I myself have contributed to the project because, Like Bitcoin,  Trezarcoin is an opensource project where ANYONE can come in and contribute.  

So if you're crying about ""unknown"" developers....   I am one of them. 


====
Having addressed the above issues.....   
The Trezarcoin community has been like a wave of fresh air...the community dives in to help support it's users, it's grown massively considering the short time it's been around and Trezarcoin is actively trying to push the boundaries of what can be done with crypto...but for the REAL WORLD.  Have a look on slack for the Trezarcoin -&gt; Expedia booking...it's an amazing example of real world use for Trezarcoin. 


My two pence.. last but not least...opinions are like ass holes and everyone has one.  :-)

Signing audit logs and maybe even chaining them to depend on each other may work (though isn't immutable).  
  
In order for a blockchain to work you need a public network, a very large one with plenty of nodes, where nodes in that network will both have of a copy of the entire chain as well as (at least some) be willing to mine blocks - a hard job that is also costly (mining bitcoin blocks these days is done by huge server farms), so you need to build incentive for people to do so. Maybe Ethereum is suited for such tasks, though you'll want to encrypt the documents/logs, that you upload and may need to have a dedicated script that runs there.  
Over all, an interesting idea, though at this time I have doubts about how practical it is.

Mimical,"Is there any reason why availability would suddenly increase?  We have been expecting ram prices to drop for over a year now and outside of some announcements on production (which does take a long time to build and ramp up) we probably will continue to see RAM prices increase.

I get that some people are relying on GPU mining suddenly becoming entirely unprofitable and there to be a massive Coin market crash, and shelves are filled with MSRP GPU's and Ebay has 1080's for 400$. However that seems relatively unlikely. Especially considering that there isnt anything to indicate that GPU mining is suddenly going to stop. Even if the market dips (as it has done before) whats to prevent it from bouncing right back up (as it has done before). 

I wouldn't count on a bubble bursting. We might be waiting for something that isn't necessarily going to happen. And even if it does, there isnt anything to suggest that another use for GPU's arises which puts demand on the market. 

Im not a miner, and am sitting here staring at GPU's and RAM prices with my jaw on the floor. My god I would adore to be able to purchase a 1070 right now. Lots of people on PCMR are saying the market will burst, and just as many people on Bitcoin sites are suggesting its only getting stronger. I dont think hedging bets to entirely one side is a smart idea. For what its worth we will probably have to come up with better ways to distribute GPU stock so that people have a fair access to them. 

I am invested in multiple GPU's at once as I work within a research field, which primarily uses GPU's for computation. So being able to purchase a machine with 4 GPU's in it is important. Although we would be purchasing either Quadro/Telsa/Titans directly from Nvidia rather then the GTX cards at a retail store. But at the same time I can see that an individual purchasing 50+ GPU's (Even if its a relatively rare event) in a single go puts immediate strain on the local inventory of that region, which is bad. 

I guess this long winded post is trying to say that its probably more complicated then just waiting for a total and complete collapse of the GPU mining field. And that either extreme like GPU mining overtakes Desktop PC's as primary consumer in the market or that GPU mining ceases to exist and become irrelevant are bets not worth taking.

In a sense you're  right in your estimate. The problem is that your estimate is based on perfect qubits and perfect qubit computations.

UHF is in the 300MHz to 3GHz range, which reaches LEO sats, but GEO sats would operate using IEEE K_a band (26.5-40 GHz) if I'm not mistaken.  You mentioned that hosting is expensive but broadcasting is okay, what about cost of the sat receiving data?

If you're using commercial sats, I imagine your upstream goes through the ""owner"" of the sat for data coordination and encryption purposes.  I could be totally making that up though, I'm way outside my field of expertise.

Recently, [Patrick Kennedy from STH made a post](https://www.servethehome.com/answer-much-bandwidth-crypto-mining-uses-1000-miners/) about how much bandwidth 1000 crypto miners use.  They ran a mix of Ethereum, Zcash, Zclassic, Bitcoin-Gold, Monero, Aeon, Digibyte, and more.  They found that a 10mbps connection can easily handle 1000 miners without issue, and all of them were running under 5k packets per second through their firewall.

In my opinion The DAO was a hardfork to reverse a hack because the people in charge of the DAO were friends with people in the ethereum foundation and people in the ethereum foundation were heavily involved in the DAO as well.  Also the hardfork was done because the foundation didn‚Äôt want a huge amount of ETH under control of a bad actor in the event ethereum moved to Proof of Stake 

The DAO fork was also done without consensus as many miners and the exchanges didn‚Äôt want the fork to happen (as evidenced by ETH Classic existing) ",dtj0td4,2,1/31/2018 11:41,,,,,,

**Author**:  _TheGreatMuffin_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;I am trying to set up a full node and after the initial syncing was at about 55% (after a couple of days), I decided to add the line ""txindex=1"" into the bitcoin.conf file.  

&gt;The client started ""syncing headers"" from scratch and after only a few hours it was at around 20%. But now the progress is painfully slow (between 0.4% and 0.8% progress increase per hour).  

&gt;I already tried restarting the client/computer and maxed out dbcache (3.5GB). The CPU usage is quite low, and the bandwidth is almost none (because it's re-syncing the already downloaded blocks).  

&gt;The bitcoin core folders are on a HDD connected with USB, so that might be a bottleneck, but at the beginning it was syncing quite quickly, so maybe there is another thing I could try/improve? At this speed I am looking at weeks and weeks of headers syncing...

Bitcoin never will be a currency because it is not stable enough. A restaurant is not pricing its stuff in bitcoin when the purchasing power of bitcoin can change drastically every day.

And before you tell me bitcoin price will stabilize enough to be a currency, give me a break. Gold's been around for thousands of years and at most, it's used in a bartering capacity to buy things. Nothing is priced in gold, just like nothing will be priced in bitcoin.

Because if you understand what crypto is and means, you understand the threat crypto poses to the banking industry - and banks obviously do too, hence their efforts to control it, and make it useless as a transactional currency. Turn up your bullshit detector a notch or two, and look around. 

Regarding LN running - actually running where? On a couple of nodes in extremely rare cases? That's not 'running', General. Even Segwit is barely used, because it's an unnecessary, overcomplicated mess of a solution to a problem that's already been solved with a far simpler AND far more effective one, that was laid out in the OG whitepaper. Have you read [the whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)?

Larger blocks are the devil though, right? Ask Blockstream, or any banker. 

Wasn't long ago the BTC mempool was nearing 200k, and average transaction fees were [north of $50](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html) - that is *ABSURD*, and NEVER should have come anywhere near even $1, or even $0.25 - yet they're still $5, and it won't be long before they're much higher again.

&gt;Silverstein: Great, and two years ago, you wrote a book ""The Curse of Cash."" And a lot of the premise of that is getting rid of big bills in large part to reduce the amount of tax evasion and criminal activity and a lot of people might think the solution then would be something like a cryptocurrency. But you actually addresses this in your book two years ago. Can you explain why you don't think bitcoin is the solution to the hundred dollar bill problem?

&gt;Rogoff: No, it's certainly bitcoin √¢‚Ç¨‚Ä?it is a solution if you're wanting to launder money or tax evasion. I think the government will eventually have to regulate it severely and I think someday will issue its own digital currency.

&gt;We have to remember the private sector invented standardized coinage, and then the government eventually regulated it, took it over √¢‚Ç¨‚Ä?different times different places. Same thing with paper currency √¢‚Ç¨‚Ä?private-sector invented it, government regulate it, took it over. What makes you think it will be different? And that bitcoin evangelist say, ""no, no, no; this is Libertarian. They will not touch us."" I'm sorry when it comes to the monetary system, the government makes the rules. You cannot win the game.

mrarjonny,"For the sake of argument 50 euro will get you ~0.01 bitcoin right now.

You will hold that bitcoin as long as you want.  You can have 0.01 bitcoin forever.  
Today it is VALUED at 50 euros because 1 bitcoin = 7964.38 euros

If the value of bitcoin drops down to 10 euros in the future, you will still have 0.01 bitcoins, but it will be valued at 0.1 Euros.  

It can't really go to zero.  

It is similar to buying a car.  You have the car, but its value might go up if it becomes a collectors edition, or a rarity and you take good care of it, or the value can go down.  How much you sell it for later can change.  But you still have the same car you bought.  You physically have the car.  

Or an even simpler example is a physical coin.  If you have a physical euro note in your hand it doesn't change.  You will always have one euro.  But twenty years from now it might be worth more or less depending on the economy and markets.  ",dtizqz1,2,1/31/2018 11:25,,,,,,

MattOmatic50,"Be real careful though and HOLD. *never* sell low unless you are absolutely 100% sure that the coin is going to tank and never recover - and you want to cut your loses. 

I've got three stop limit trx sells on the exchange, one to sell for 0.00009 eth, one for 0.000075 and one for 0.00006550. The price has hit a real low recently and it could be that way for some time. The different sell stops equate to the different prices I purchased at, a few hundred below each time. 

I only ever work in ETH - pointless working with the dollar value. Ultimately, I'm trying to increase my ETH holdings and keep topping up my 'cold storage' paper wallet - but if TRX starts performing well, I'll keep them. 

You can be left holding for some time, the trick is to never ever sell at a loss. 

If you've got the cash, diversify big time - you'll need a decent method to track everything, spreadsheet with as much data as is necessary to track every trade, including the trade cost itself.

One trick that's worked for me is to check the coin market in three places - the very bottom - the coins that have lost the most over time, the middle, the coins that are either going up or down and the very top - the coins that are either going up or could be on the way back down. Check the lowest price in 24hrs and the highest. This can inform you quickly the potential. If the 24hr high is considerably higher than the current, chances are, the price is going down. 
Then there's the longer method, check the candlestick chart, the depth and the order book. This is actually pretty difficult to gauge unless you are an expert. I'm still learning how to do it. 

You can also check the 'Pump and Dump' spikes over time on a number of coins and hedge your bets there. Buy low, set a stop limit price at say, half of the last pump rate and just leave it in your open orders. You may get lucky and hit a pump if you diversify - I've done that once and made a fair bit. I didn't get near the top of the pump, but I sold half way up it. Play it safe. There's no way you can beat the pump 'n dump crowd unless you're in on it.

What I've found is that the relatively stable (at the moment) TRX, POE, FUN - low price coins - fluctuate enough to sometimes do repeat increments of holdings over as little as 20 minutes. Not being greedy is the key. Sell at just enough of a gain to catch the fluctations, to slightly increase your holdings and to cover the transaction cost. 
Clearly, bots are where this method really shines, but I just can't figure them out - the open source ones are so damn complicated. The ones you buy are just too damn expensive for my tastes.

This is by no means a flawless method, otherwise I wouldn't be right now, sitting with nothing to trade on, but I haven't sold yet, so arguably, I haven't made a loss. 

I made a promise to myself to keep my earnings on TRX in ETH and to leave money on the exchange to play with. Took out everything I invested two weeks back into my bank account in FIAT and ended up with a big chunk of ETH in cold storage, as I believe some time in the future - could be years - Ethereum will forge ahead of Bitcoin. It' my very long term hold - years. I left some on the exchange to learn - and I'm still learning. Ultimately, I intend to start trying this with shares - crypto is my paddling pool, where I'm learning to have a cool head and to try to spot the potential gains. ",dtizogb,2,1/31/2018 11:24,,,,,,

I am a firm domme - well experienced in virtually all D/s dynamics. I love playing with sissies and cucks but I thoroughly enjoy vanilla (non-fetish related) play as well. I love odd requests and encourage you to bring me fun/challenging requests (with an accompanying budget). I am 420 friendly and I **do** show face!

###My Snapchat handle is [xlaineylovex](https://snapchat.com/add/xlaineylovex)
###My kik handle is LaineyLactate

---------------------------

* **PM me on Reddit when you are looking for a Snapchat subscription or session**
* **Do NOT contact me on kik/snap unless you are ready to send payment**
* **If you contact me to arrange a session on kik please include: a description of the session you're looking for(text only, vid heavy etc as well as any fetish requests), a budget that matches the pricing listed below, your intended payment method (options below), and when you want to do the session. Messages outside of this format will be redirected to Reddit. PM me by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=laineyloves2lactate)** 
* **If you have any questions pertaining to Snapchat or sending payment read the entirety of my ad as well as my ToS on my subreddit (r/laineylove) and PM me on Reddit with your question or intended payment method.**

-------------------------

##Lainey's Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. Please note that I also offer kik sessions at the same rates as snap! As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions where you will have my full attention for the duration of your session. Unless otherwise negotiated I will start clothed and strip throughout the session, showing myself off, and interacting with whatever content you decide to send me. Once the session has started I will not pause or delay the session for any reason. While I'm open to suggestions and requests during your session, I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate our agreement without refund and may result in being banned on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on kik or Snapchat but it is my preference to use kik and it allows you to have the conversation for later use üòâ

-------------------------

##Cock and Cumshot Ratings

###Options for ratings include:

Rate|Price
:--|:-:
Text|$15
Video|$25
Nude Video|$35

My ratings are provided in clips through kik recorded just for you. All video ratings vary in length depending on how much I have to say but will include a 1-10 rating as well as a detailed review about its appearance, what I would do with it, and my overall satisfaction. If you want me to use your name please allow for an additional $10 and I'll make sure to use it throughout the entire rating as if you were sitting right there before me, ready to play. Ratings are not intended to be interactive so please refrain from making any requests. I do not provide any pics/vids to help you get ready for your rate but I encourage you to check out r/LaineyLove to get yourself rock hard üòâ

This may include: nudes, teasing, public exposure, day to day check-ins, boy/girl content, early access to sales, updates on pre-made videos! I have been having a wild time and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day. For premium subscribers and only at my discretion I will open any content sent to me although I reserve the right to respond. I prefer to receive pictures of you smoking, chilling with your pets, doing something exciting, and **NOT** NSFW content. This does NOT include any guaranteed interaction and buyers should not purchase a snapchat subscription with the expectation of having daily chat.

How can you DAYTRADE or Short-term speculate on Bitcoin???  Its like daytrading on the Internet if in the 90's there would be an ""internet"" coin. But after decades, guess what. the internet is STILL HERE!!! When do you get it already that this is a technological change, not some pennystocks game!?  

&gt;Bitcoin has the unique usecase of being THE only and best STORAGE OF VALUE, FOR LIFE!  Better and more comfortable to store than physical heavy gold or silver!!

&gt;Just like gold/silver are ONLY value store in the real world next to cash, Bitcoin is the ONLY reasonable one in the digital world (maybe one more Reasonable verium, see below)! But thats it! Just like gold/silver, no more place for others for THIS usecase , value store can only be comprised of max. 2 coins!!

&gt;So just stop comparing btc to the damn altcoins which one is faster etc. Nobody pays with gold!It is ok not to pay with btc! Just like in the real world nobody pays with gold, but with cash or banktransfers,  in crypto you should just pay with n altcoin that is at one moment more suitable for THAT usecase (and this applies for every other usecases)! 

&gt;There can be thousands of altcoins , with highly innovative new features, but ONLY ONE suitable for the store of value! So trade your awesome altcoins but NEVER misuse btc for short term speculations in general! Store of value means storing=holding. Just get it into your heads already!!

&gt;Damn panicking people all over the world. What kind of shizophrenia is it to react  on EVERY single news when the ACTUAL usecase of btc is LONGTERM VALUE STORE for lifetime!?

&gt;Which coin other than btc is giving you 10years stability of transactions hashes history?!?! IF you wanna gamle, moon, and trade and support innovative ideas, look at the ALTCOINS for that!  Promote your favorite alts. But btc has already its place, so no damn speculation and panic reactions like chickens when in comes to bitcoin! No daytrade and sell.offs needed, you harm yourself , we all are for decentralization!  Longterm support is only way to promote new technologies. BTC is for hold and getting ""IN"". Altcoins do the rest.

&gt;i want anyone who comes accross this thread to remember to think and look cryptos from perspective of USE CASES and to remember one of the most important usecase of value storage.

&gt;If this usecase wouldnt be so important, you wouldnt have hundreds of central banks fighting about control on physical gold and buying and sitting on it!

&gt;People have to realize the magnitude of this usecase.

&gt;And i think many people really do not grasp the idea, because all the time they talk about qquick transactions etc. They got tricked by mainsstream media into putting btc in the same pool as altcoins! but this is illogical when there has to be ONE coin for storage of value. you have to separate.

&gt;gold is held by every country for EXACTLY that same reason- for the reason of value store and safety net for any future risks or collapses of financial system (counterpart in the crypto world would be: for any risks and collapses in the ""altcoin"" world""!!! 

&gt;just imagine, how psycho would it be to say gold transactions are slower than banktransfers? people have to educate themselves about how to look at crypto economy. its nothing new, just digital! you find for everything the counterpart jn the real world. gold is THE only counterparty for btc.

temanon,"I would not agree with you that there is no integrations on cardano roadmap. Even better they are already in the works.

1) Charles has said multiple times that 3rd party company is integrating Ledger support and it should be available soon. It is on the cardanoroadmap but has no progress bar because it is not up to Cardano but 3rd party. Charles also confirmed that you will be able to cold stake it from your Ledger which I think is absolutely awesome. I for one will use this option.  (Is on roadmap)

2) You can wait for Light client wallet support. I think this will take some more time and is in theory not as secure as 1). (Is on roadmap)

3) You raise up to the challenge and use full node for now, which at least for me works better than 90% of other full node crypto wallets.

4) You will be able to print paper wallets for your friends which should make things pretty simple for them.  (Is on roadmap)



And also I wanna make a note that this is being worked in parallel. And you can't expect people working on core SL to do work on Ledger integration and Light client. This is not an after school crypto project.

And you should know that you are an early investor. If you don't like it buy EOS or some other ERC20 token with no mainnet and Ethereum wallet. There is a price to pay for being an early investor.

That being said every full node works like that if you ever tried Bitcoin or Ethereum. The difference is you wait a looooooot more using those full nodes. To be fair they have a lot of blocks.

Good luck!

vivaelmario,"This is actually a very important topic to discuss, because it reveals waltonchain superiority over other blockchain tokens/currencies. 

First off what is the reason people are putting their money into crypto? Back in the day when bitcoin started there were many people interested in the idea of a new way to make transactions, overthrowing banks, lots of programming enthusiasts. Nowadays the majority, my guess is way over 90%, are here to make more money. 

Bitcoins success pricewise can be explained using principle trading rules, like if the supply becomes lower(people loosing or holding), demand becomes larger(people using or nowadays buying, because hype), then the price rise. There have been a lot of new crypto tokens created which have the use case - being a currency, but all of them have the same problem, they are volatile and rarely user friendly or as adopted as btc is. There will be a time when the vast majority of these coins will lose their value almost entirely, because if there are a few of well developed, scaling and adopted crypto-currencies, then there is no need to have hundreds of them. When people find out that trading these past few years and maybe a few more to come was based mostly on speculation (bitcoin and a few others like litecoin raised i value, so othera will; investing because of certain ways one or other can be mined; marketing model; etc ) there will be a great wash and those tokens that will emerge will very likely be PoS with a realy good use case applicable in a corporate business level. Why? Because that gives reason for people to hold (PoS rewards practically make it an asset) and buy more (far more than the amount of some casual person spending to order stuff on ebay). Those two factors will make a few tokens skyrocket in value and other collapse. 

In my eyes when a global cryptocurency will be completely different to what we have as examples right now, because bitcoin and other are becoming something that they were build to work against - centralisation. Wealth is easily drawn to those who manipulate very large capitals and manipulate accumulatig more. Why would that be a global free world currency?

We shoukd be looking at an actual use case, for example there are a lot of blockchain projects that have tokens that get burned when a particular task is completed, say neo's gas and and ether, but does it really make them to be valued billions in market cap? One day we will know.

Considering the above, it becomes clear why waltonchain is a very valuable token to hold, but only in relation to others, because (I'll probably get downvoted for the following) if crypto market is a bubble and the bubble bursts, then walton might be #1 crypto and still have a 100mn$ market cap. Or 10mn$, or even 1mn$, who knows. 
Althought what a juicy dip that that'd be.

WikiTextBot,"**Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

Conversely, highly competent individuals may erroneously presume that tasks easy for them to perform are also easy for other people to perform, or that other people will have a similar understanding of subjects that they themselves are well-versed in.

AtLeastSignificant,"As many Bitcoin supporters would say - ""Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's a store of value"".

Neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum are or will ever be currencies. They also aren't nor will ever be stores of value.  This is simply due to the fact that they are too volatile and not backed by any physical asset.  

Frankly, I don't think Bitcoin has *any* good use case anymore. 

Ethereum on the other hand is incredibly useful as a programmable &amp; trustless medium of exchange.

We will replace USD with a stablecoin like Dai, not Ether.  Trustless transactions will take place by moving the stable currency to Ether, processing via smart contract, and then transfer back to the stable currency.",dtizg3r,2,1/31/2018 11:20,,,,,,

They probably had to keep printing tethers because of the demand for this service alone. Just say we find out tether isn't backed by US dollars binance could still continue to use it as long as people are still willing to trade with it. They could even create their own altcoin called stablecoin or some shit replace all tethers with it so nobody loses any money. Without a stable altcoin like tether all of the real big money will leave because they don't want to go through the hassle of getting in and out of the market all the time. if tether is found out to be a fraud the market will most likely go down further only because weak hands will panic and sell,dtizbjf,2,1/31/2018 11:18,,,,,,

tooltime88,"Great episode! Q, regardless of who or what it is, is a fascinating chunk of today's American history and these are the guys I come to for info on the subject. Bitcoin is something that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up, it has so much potential for good and bad. Personally the fact that it relies on our shotty technology makes me keep it at a distance for now, but never the less it's a part of our culture, so we have to at least keep it on the radar. I'm not familiar with Andy Kaufman but it sounds like he was an interesting feller, but Bigfoot I am familiar with and may even share some genes with that hairy guy! üòÇ
I haven't told this story in years but when I was a teenager I missed a Bigfoot sighting by less than 5 minutes. The area I grew up is a pretty rural part of Ohio and I spent a great deal of time in the woods riding ATV's and all the normal rednecky things. One day my family and another family were out riding on an old railroad bed that the tracks had been removed, so it made for a nice flat smooth ride and you could cover many miles in a single days ride. I mention the terrain because it is relevant to why I missed the sighting. We were moving along at probably 30mph or so and at those speeds off road you kick up a lot of dust, and we had to leave a lot of space between each other for visibility. I think I was second in line that day and came up on the leader driving slowly off the side of the trail standing up and ducking and looking all around through the brush and tress, he was not exactly panicky but definitely excited about something. He couldn't go far off the trail because the growth was pretty thick and it would have been nearly impossible to get through or I think he would have chased whatever he saw. When we all caught up to that point he shut off his bike and started with ""I don't know what it was but it was up on 2 legs and it was big!"" Of course we all started teasing him and joking about it being a sasquatch and all the normal tomfoolery that would accompany such a claim. In his defense though he never said it was a Bigfoot he said he just didn't know what it was only that it was out of the ordinary. It wasn't till years later that I read about other sasquatch type signs such as smells and rock throwing and stuff, which were all things I noticed in that area growing up. I assumed the musky smell was just coyotes or something but never put much thought at all into it actually being a cryptid... hell I Didn't even know the term Cryptid back then. The more I read and hear about other people's stories the more I realize that area may have been much stranger than I originally thought and I can't wait to get an ATV again and get back out there!!

&gt;It's a 1 click Bitcoin Cash blockchain for devs to test their apps against before deploying to the real network. It consists of a web GUI and a command line tool.

&gt;**Web GUI&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;The web GUI lets you spin up as many BCH addresses as you want w/ an auto generated or custom mnemonic and derivation path. You can also toggle showing the address in cashaddr or old school format

&gt;On the wallets page you can toggle each address between the public key and private key in WIF.

&gt;**Command line&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;There is also a command line component:  [https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitbox-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitbox-cli) 

&gt;&lt;code&gt;bitbox init --title helloworld&lt;/code&gt; it'll stub out a directory structure w/ a bitbox.js file that has localhost:8332 settings to connect to your local running BITBOX.

&gt;&lt;code&gt;bitbox console&lt;/code&gt; has a custom node REPL w/ the entire BCH RPC on a BitcoinCash object

&gt;**Summary&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;The goal of this project is to improve the BCH developer experience and accelerate how quickly devs can bring BCH app to market.

Unless the programming variable is changed, in which case the supply is infinite. Once all the coins have been mined the only incentive to sustain bitcoin will be transaction fees which will have to explode. Anyone transacting in bitcoin would have to bear all the mining costs directly (if mining is unprofitable or unincentivized, then no one will mine).

At that point there are many special interests such as miners or anyone that wants transaction costs minimized would welcome increasing new issuance of bitcoin. ",dtiz2yd,2,1/31/2018 11:15,,,,,,

moonccy,"I agree with the overall sentiment that you will have a massive culling of useless cryptos over the next year or so. However, what I think you're missing about simply saying Eth will replace everything is the value around the token capital structure. The ability to reward multiple types of participants in a network and incentivize adoption is very novel. Additionally the simple fact that ICOs allow smaller investors to get in on early stage VC projects means companies with this structure could continue to be very viable going forward, as long as the legal framework evolves sufficiently to allow them. 

Also not sure about the logic of saying you'd have a major culling of duplicative currencies, but somehow bitcoin, bcash, and litecoin would continue to exist. ",dtiz13n,2,1/31/2018 11:14,,,,,,

But it also occurs to me that there are probably many, many recent buyers who are now like I was - who speculatively chucked a few hundred dollars at bitcoin and are mostly indifferent unless it REALLY crashes or REALLY moons. It's traders who set the price, sure, but every cycle a new generation of holders is born, reducing the circulating supply of coins each time.

How can you DAYTRADE or Short-term speculate on Bitcoin???  Its like daytrading on the Internet if in the 90's there would be an ""internet"" coin. But after decades, guess what. the internet is STILL HERE!!! When do you get it already that this is a technological change, not some pennystocks game!?  

&gt;Bitcoin has the unique usecase of being THE only and best STORAGE OF VALUE, FOR LIFE!  Better and more comfortable to store than physical heavy gold or silver!!

&gt;Just like gold/silver are ONLY value store in the real world next to cash, Bitcoin is the ONLY reasonable one in the digital world (maybe one more Reasonable verium, see below)! But thats it! Just like gold/silver, no more place for others for THIS usecase , value store can only be comprised of max. 2 coins!!

&gt;So just stop comparing btc to the damn altcoins which one is faster etc. Nobody pays with gold!It is ok not to pay with btc! Just like in the real world nobody pays with gold, but with cash or banktransfers,  in crypto you should just pay with n altcoin that is at one moment more suitable for THAT usecase (and this applies for every other usecases)! 

&gt;There can be thousands of altcoins , with highly innovative new features, but ONLY ONE suitable for the store of value! So trade your awesome altcoins but NEVER misuse btc for short term speculations in general! Store of value means storing=holding. Just get it into your heads already!!

&gt;Damn panicking people all over the world. What kind of shizophrenia is it to react  on EVERY single news when the ACTUAL usecase of btc is LONGTERM VALUE STORE for lifetime!?

&gt;Which coin other than btc is giving you 10years stability of transactions hashes history?!?! IF you wanna gamle, moon, and trade and support innovative ideas, look at the ALTCOINS for that!  Promote your favorite alts. But btc has already its place, so no damn speculation and panic reactions like chickens when in comes to bitcoin! No daytrade and sell.offs needed, you harm yourself , we all are for decentralization!  Longterm support is only way to promote new technologies. BTC is for hold and getting ""IN"". Altcoins do the rest.

&gt;i want anyone who comes accross this thread to remember to think and look cryptos from perspective of USE CASES and to remember one of the most important usecase of value storage.

&gt;If this usecase wouldnt be so important, you wouldnt have hundreds of central banks fighting about control on physical gold and buying and sitting on it!

&gt;People have to realize the magnitude of this usecase.

&gt;And i think many people really do not grasp the idea, because all the time they talk about qquick transactions etc. They got tricked by mainsstream media into putting btc in the same pool as altcoins! but this is illogical when there has to be ONE coin for storage of value. you have to separate.

&gt;just imagine, how psycho would it be to say gold transactions are slower than banktransfers? people have to educate themselves about how to look at crypto economy. its nothing new, just digital! you find for everything the counterpart jn the real world. gold is THE only counterparty for btc.

&gt;@@@and IF there is even slightly one other coin suitable for storage, it would be VERIUM   [https://twitter.com/VeriCoin/status/936716215640195072](https://twitter.com/VeriCoin/status/936716215640195072)

This is because you are able to deposit FIAT currency such as USD to make your purchases. This is also the case with some other exchanges such as Kraken, pointed out by SheikhShake. When exchanges offer USD pairings, the price for Bitcoin or whatever you're buying is typically going to be slightly higher than on exchanges which don't offer a USD pairing. Because it's easier to BUY, and buying is the thing that drives a price up.

Coinbase also has another element which contributes to higher Bitcoin prices - zero fees. If you trade on GDAX with limit orders you are subject to 0% trading fees. Granted, any other type of order has fees, but because of this GDAX is very popular and drives a lot of volume from non-serious investors. Bottom line - the ability to purchase Bitcoin with USD and with 0% trading fees means it's a lot easier for the price to go up on Coinbase than it is for an exchange like Binance. And of course, it never goes up TOO far as if it does, people will start arbitraging.",dtiytaf,2,1/31/2018 11:11,,,,,,

&gt;It's a 1 click Bitcoin Cash blockchain for devs to test their apps against before deploying to the real network. It consists of a web GUI and a command line tool.

&gt;**Web GUI&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;The web GUI lets you spin up as many BCH addresses as you want w/ an auto generated or custom mnemonic and derivation path. You can also toggle showing the address in cashaddr or old school format

&gt;On the wallets page you can toggle each address between the public key and private key in WIF.

&gt;**Command line&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;There is also a command line component:  [https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitbox-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitbox-cli) 

&gt;&lt;code&gt;bitbox init --title helloworld&lt;/code&gt; it'll stub out a directory structure w/ a bitbox.js file that has localhost:8332 settings to connect to your local running BITBOX.

&gt;&lt;code&gt;bitbox console&lt;/code&gt; has a custom node REPL w/ the entire BCH RPC on a BitcoinCash object

&gt;**Summary&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;The goal of this project is to improve the BCH developer experience and accelerate how quickly devs can bring BCH app to market.

Consider the following:

Whenever some mainstream #FakeNews article discusses crypto, in any light there's at least a few hundred things it could talk about, of which at least 20 or 30 are fairly large. But which does it almost always solely discuss?

Bitcoin (obviously), and Ripple (banker scam coin).

Now consider these articles were overwhelmingly positive for a bit and then became overwhelmingly negative like a light switch. Then consider Tether is also from a bank. Then consider that hack attacks on individual exchanges and the like are portrayed as damaging crypto as a whole... which makes about as much sense as a bank robbery negatively affecting the value of US dollars. If people thought they were losing value they wouldn't steal them.

It's really very simple. Statist bank attack on crypto so they can keep printing infinite money based on nothing, then take your finite money anyways because fuck you.

Combine that with putting a lot of noise in the system, aka everyone wants their own little ICO shitcoin now including video game company Crytek and failed political leader Theresa May... and these will be shilled as if they are legitimate and have a strong backing and the end result is that crypto appears as a joke and most people abandon it.

It certainly doesn't help that at least one guy around here tried one of those ICO shitcoins in question (Red Pill Coin) and there's a few statist shills running about as well, taking pleasure in the misfortune of others.

This is not true. There has to be value beyond the means of transaction use case. Otherwise, other coins would serve this purpose equally as well. The network and blockchain are what's important. Holding Bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against other markets is a sustainable use case, imo. It's also impossible to make large transactions if the market cap is too small, especially if liquidity is low.

CoinHours will be posted as collateral for mixing to prevent participants from backing out of or slowing down CoinJoin transactions. Skycoin CoinJoin transactions improve the mathematical guarantee of Skycoin transaction privacy by spending outputs from multiple wallets in the same transaction. This prevents the most common deanonymizing attacks in Bitcoin. When fully implemented, this will give Skycoin a ZeroCoin-level mathematical guarantee of transaction privacy, with orders of magnitude less complexity and computation overhead than the ZeroCoin implementation, by eliminating the requirement of the highly complicated zero-knowledge proof system.

Cat-on-a-piano,"A few quick points as my phone battery is low

- The Tether situation is far from the the only cause of the recent meteoric rise in BTC price. Blockchain technology is advancing fast and groups are attempting to innovate left right and centre. People claimed the rises from cents to dollars and from dollars to tens of dollars were meteoric also but this is the process of price discovery. 

- Blockchains like Bitcoins are suedo annonymous, they aren't designed to be fully annonymous. Multiple blockchain privacy projects do have a high degree of anonymity through technologies which run on their blockchains like zk-snarks, ring signatures etc found in coins such as Monero, Particl, ZCash. Bitcoin may in the future have anon features of the network/mining consensus thinks it should.

Price discovery is an interesting process especially when applied to a technology the world has not seen before. Blockchain (not nessesarily Bitcoin) will be integral in the way we live our future. 

A quick example of what is certainly to come in the future - blockchain secured operating systems which allow for computing on a platform which cannot be hacked, your files cannot be tampered my malicious parties, your data secure to be read only by those holding your private key (for example).

Anything where power is held centrally can be improved heavily by blockchain. 

Google ""Bezantine Generals Problem"" - Bitcoin and in particular blockchains are the only solutions to that long lasting problem as of now.

Blockchain has a bright future, the internet wasn't built in a day, nor will blockchain technology.

Let this settle in - as we move to cashless societies do we really want our only option to transact with a fellow human to be handled through a corporation? 

Bitcoin/blockchain isn't going anywhere, price will eb and flow as markets do but the blockchain party is only getting started.

For example, if you were to use the same address for a hospital visit as for a trip to the hair salon, the salon or anyone knowing their address and yours would know that you had a hospital visit if the hospitals address is publicly known.  There are address mappers out there for Bitcoin for example that work to match address with entities.

Skycoin will be implementing CoinJoin which is a feature designed to improve privacy; until that‚Äôs rolled out, I‚Äôm not entirely sure how that will function although offhand I believe it involves mixing transfers to help mask where transactions are being sent by a specific person.

I_shall_be_at_Aqaba,"The first step to invest in bitcoin is to choose the bitcoin exchange that will convert your traditional currency into bitcoin.  There are dozens of  bitcoin exchanges you can use to purchase Bitcoin. Choosing a bitcoin exchange involves trade-offs between usability, features, and cost.  Each bitcoin exchange will strike a different balance.  The questions you should ask yourself before you buy bitcoin are:

* How easy does the bitcoin exchange make it to buy bitcoin?
* What are the fees for trading, deposits, and withdrawals?
* Do I want to buy bitcoin with a bank account transfer (cheaper) or a credit/debit card (more expensive)?
* How does the bitcoin exchange protect or insure my fiat currency and bitcoin deposit accounts?
* Do I want to use or learn some advanced features?

You might find helpful the [Beginner's Guide to Choosing a Bitcoin Exchange](https://cryptospaceguides.com/beginners-guide-choose-bitcoin-exchange/) at Crypto Space Guides.

axolotl_peyotl,"This article, while a mishmash of high octane speculation, hits at some *really* fascinating concepts that shouldn't be dismissed outright.

Quoting from another article:

&gt;To create a really strong AI you need to introduce a chaos pattern that it can learn human response from. It's starting to look like they used #VegasStrong as a cover operation to launch a strong AI backed by cryptocurrency. 

&gt;MGM uses Palantir. The FBI uses Palantir. If Palantir is being used to mine cryptocurrency for MGM Resorts, then we have a gigantic collusion.

The original article continues:

&gt;Mr. Michaels is really arguing that crypto-currencies are a component of what I've been calling a hidden system of finance, and indeed, I have been arguing and implying that this technology is the latest addition to the hidden finance system family.

And here comes the *real* high octane speculation:

&gt;BitCoin was actually created by artificial intelligence, for artificial intelligence, and then modified by human beings.

And taken even further:

&gt;Since criminal activity is at the base of BitCoin, then criminal activity forms the base logic of AI.

The author concludes:

&gt;Elon Musk has warned of the dangers of AI perhaps invoking or transducing something ""unpleasant"" or even evil, but Michaels has gone further and basically said, it's already here, and has already happened, because that's the way it was designed.",dtixxif,2,1/31/2018 10:57,,,,,,

MarchewkaCzerwona,"This is sub for bitcoin, but you can also talk about bitcoin cash which some believe is closer to original bitcoin vision than bitcoin with segwit and block limit.

On r/bitcoin you can't talk about bitcoin cash as it is against that sub rules. 

When it comes to subs dedicated to bitcoin cash like r/bch and r/bitcoincash, I'm not sure is it not run by people actually against it, so I stay here on r/btc.

When it comes to bitcoin. com, I believe it is about both btc and bch.

Last year there was major event that most people are not aware of its importance. Bitcoin has split, went into two different vision. Btc with its 1mb block and future second layer solution and bch, that stayed with on chain transactions and bigger blocks. I called it once a internal struggle of bitcoin and although I wasn't sure at that time is that the best description of what happened, I'm getting more convinced I was right.

Bitcoin with only 1mb kept its name and most of miners, but I personally moved to bch for both practical and ideological reasons. 

I wish bitcoin well and I am happy we have now two different competing visions working. That's healthy. Saying that, I wish competition could be more civil as current venom between is not healthy.

Last thing, controversial maybe, with time I'm getting more and more convinced that bitcoin 1mb society is manipulated, vile and aggressive.

But to see BTC drop so dramatically and repeatedly dip below the $10k line worries me. It's only an arbitrary number like any other but I suppose it holds that notion of being a milestone.

Tied in with the fact that the whole market still relies on BTC I can see a lot of people losing money if this bearish trend continues and if people start to sell to hold onto their stakes we could see a new floor emerge.

2. High fees
Pretty explanatory. Transfer some BTC to a different exchange or send some to a friend and note the fee. Last time I transferred BTC the fee was 30% of the amount I was transferring... that‚Äôs more than a wire transfer. 

3. No privacy

Explodicle,"&gt; They won't understand why they have to make large down payments far ahead of time before they can spend. They won't understand what channels they need to open up and why they have to pay into it as well.

They already need to make down payments ahead of time (buying bitcoins) before they can spend. By the time LN is ready for mass use (which it isn't now), the user won't be exposed to channels. Their initial buy will establish a payment channel with whoever sold them their coins, and if their software can't find a route for later purchases then it'll create a new channel automatically. 

&gt; It doesn't just work transparently behind the scenes, and requires a completely different and more cumbersome user experience for the masses to easily adapt to.

How do you think it's different from [this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_pTB8gCuvQ)? I understand that copying and pasting a long address is a pain in the neck, but that will eventually be streamlined with [URIs like bitcoin: links have now](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki), [payment protocols](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki), etc.

&gt; It would be easier for users to switch to a different coin that is more user friendly and easier to understand than to switch to Lightning.

There are exchange fees between coins, and then either the low liquidity of unpopular alts or the censorship risk of popular alts. If they're already using Bitcoin, then they can upgrade to a LN client in a single transaction. The average person doesn't care to understand how their money works; just that it does.

By the time it's ready for mass use, the user will care as much about LN channels as they care about finding peers and relaying transactions.",dtixgb6,2,1/31/2018 10:49,,,,,,

ftrader,"I agree with deadalnix and others here on the need to keep Bitcoin Cash free of patent encumbrances, if necessary by fork.

Let's be realistic. Since ""blockchain"", there are probably entities creating trivial software patents en masse, with the intent to monetize on existing deployed tech (i.e., retroactive patent trolling). I recently saw an article with numbers about patents which a big financial institution was filing. Unfortunately I forgot the link.

We must assume that patents (and other forms of IP) will be used as a weapon to squash Bitcoin Cash as it gains adoption.

Patent holders can attack _some_ companies (mainly high-value targets) using patents, but they will not be able to go after every company worldwide that chooses to run Bitcoin Cash or related open source software.

It is important to be vigilant, to identify patents that might threaten Bitcoin Cash, especially if someone tries to sneak patented methods into the protocol (I am not talking about specific implementations, but into the protocol). Then we would need to figure out alternative ways of doing things that don't require such patents.

Ultimately, we must insist on keeping Bitcoin (Cash) open source _at all costs_. We should also support protocol implementations that feature explicit _free software licenses_ such as GPL.

---

Ultimately, it's about whether you want Bitcoin (Cash) to remain permissionless. Anyone should be able to mine without any sort of special permission. That includes having to license any patented software.

Miners would be unwise to move away from this attribute. It should be in their interest for many others to use and improve various Bitcoin Cash implementations. This lowers the risk to themselves of suffering financial loss due to bad software.

If a proprietary solution is better than open one, miners will pay to use it and that's also fine.",dtix6cv,2,1/31/2018 10:45,,,,,,
clubbnbabyseals,"the book was one of the worst assemblages of straw men, outright factual misstatement, and argument by logical fallacy i have ever seen. the overall work is rendered essentially devoid of content.

it's so wrong about so many things it's not even wrong. it's literally orthogonal. the author's grasp of libertarianism, monetary policy, Austrian economics, and basic ideas like inflation is so awful as to be not even parody-able he cannot tell the difference between exchange rate and inflation, ascribes the idea that money supply is what drives inflation to fringe kooks when it is the bedrock of mainstream monetarists (especially and including milton friedman), and probably sets a record in his first chapter for the most uses of the ""because one, all"" fallacy.

some guys on a charboard years before bitcoin discussed some similar ideas and liked some manifesto that i will not describe but i assure you is kookery therefore that manifesto was key to satoshi's vision and all bitcoiners!

90% of his arguments are just like that. ""hitler was a vegetarian. therefore all vegetarians are fascists bent on world domination"". the other 10% are flat out misstatements and straw men. he amusingly accuses others of presuming competence in some domain grants them competence in others, but this describes him more aptly than any he criticizes. he is literally an economic and philosophical illiterate with a chip on his shoulder and unable to see how deep in the ""everyone is stupid but me"" camp he is because he has no idea what anyone else actually beleives and just makes up opinions for them.

honestly, this is one of the most unreadable messes i have ever come across. a first year logic student with zero knowledge of any of the subject matter could tear his book to shreds just by diagramming the arguments. they are literally so bad as to be independent of content. you could put ANYTHING in them and it would still not be valid because the basic structure is logically invalid.

BlockCheney,"&gt; You kids and your fiat values.

It makes a lot more sense to think of your portfolio in USD (or EUR or GBP) than in Bitcoin or Ethereum though. $1,000 today is pretty similar to $1,000 last year, but 1BTC is very different now from 1BTC a year ago because it's changed so much in value.

It's not about fiat being special per se, but rather because fiat is relatively stable (most currencies). Hell, if you wanted to, you could measure your portfolio in gold, silver, or even barrels of oil, all of which are much more stable than cryptocurrency. But you wouldn't think of your portfolio in terms of Zimbabwean dollars because that, like cryptocurrency, is not stable (it goes down rather than up, but it's still a problem).",dtix45g,2,1/31/2018 10:44,,,,,,

1\. They don't. They spend as much as you want. You can run Bitcoin on 2 PIs, it just won't be secure. It's just that it is a great bargain to be a miner right now, that's why there's so much energy going on it. The rewards are getting smaller so things will change. 

2\. 8\. 9\. 10\. These are totally true, but only because of the low adoption, which is totally normal as it's a new thing and it's a big change. 

3\. True. Being able to reverse a mistake/hack is good, but at what cost? If they're done by a consensus algorithm, I'm up for them. But if to have that comfort you have to give up the power over your money to a third party, no thank you. 

4\. Yes, they can. Will be able to handle more and more in the future. BCH will be able to take more than Visa, with a 1GB blocksize limit, but it needs to adoption first.

5\. Bitcoin fees are stupid, artificial high. BCH fees will remain 1sat/byte forever. 

6\. A transaction should be taken as totally confirmed after at least 6 blocks, so that's an hour. Excluding Bitcoin, most of your transactions will be 0-conf, so about instant, though there will be a little chance that something happens. I'm willing to wait an hour if I'm buying a car or a house. For coffee and shoes, 0-conf is perfect. 

7\. Currently, there's some concentration, but nothing to worry about. In the future, I don't know, it might get problematic, but I'm not seeing a better solution. 

11\. I suspect you may be right. I've just posted this question to some crypto subs. Would love to hear your thoughts on the deflationary spiral. 

12\. I don't find this valid, because it's true for absolutely everything. If you joined early and are holding elephant tusks, you're a whale and can heavily influence any market. That's the always the case with investments and having a lot of money.

I bought in mid 2017 and went through the China ban dip.  At that time, I was down about 30% at the bottom.  I held because I refused to sell at a loss and thought bitcoin would one day be at a higher price and I could wait.  Now after being in crypto for just six months, I'm just thinking about all of the BS that crypto brings, and how I could be without it.

I'll hold for now though.  I think I'm just getting drained from this constant bleed.  I've already sold my initial contribution, so I can't lose money overall, but can miss out on profit. I'm still a big believer in bitcoin, but this past month has been rough.",dtiwznn,2,1/31/2018 10:42,,,,,,

arrozconplatano,"

It isn't enough for something to require labor in order for it to be a commodity in the Marxist sense, it must also have a use value. It's unclear whether Bitcoin actually has any use value. You currently can't buy very many things with it and transaction fees are so high it is usually more practical to pay in fiat.


The second issue is that in classical political economy, there's no reason speculation won't raise the market price above the value of a commodity. The labor value merely represents the cost of production of a commodity. Any additional price above the cost of production falls under the category of rent.

SirTwitchALot,"That's how economics works though. Something is worth whatever it trades for. What you've described is a cartel. If everyone holding BTC tomorrow refused to sell for less than 100k, it would of course sell for that price. This could lead to a new high, it could also lead to the collapse of BTC since it's just as likely people who currently use BTC for real world transactions might find such a sudden jump to be worth the hassle of switching to an altcoin. My crystal ball isn't good enough to guess which of those scenarios might play out, but we'll never find out anyway because there is enough supply that there are plenty of people who will be willing to part with their stash for the already impressive capital growth they have seen so far.

Right now people are buying bitcoin for a few reasons, but here are the two that matter the most in my opinion:

1. to spend it. This is the eventual goal of crypocurrencies, to be useful as a store of value. Being able to purchase goods and services is the keystone holding everything up

2. Speculation. People have varying levels of confidence that the first factor will occur and BTC will become a widely accepted way to conduct financial transactions. Some people are hoping that BTC will skyrocket in its intrinsic value and want to ride that wave for personal gain. The collector could tell the second person they're foolish and should hold on for a better price, but the intrinsic value is different for the two people.


Another angle to consider. If someone owns a 1979 Chevy Nova and thinks it's going to be a collectors item some day, they would probably not sell it at a low price. Someone else who owns the same vehicle as a daily driver might very well be willing to part with it at a discount. ",dtiwshg,2,1/31/2018 10:39,,,,,,

If you're totally new to electron-cash &amp; ledger than allow a full-on crypto-weekend to learn the special ropes needed for detecting 1-sats on the nano.

set up your bch wallet to operate on the split chain. install bitcoin cash wallet 1.1.8 from the chrome browser and launch it..

click both ledger buttons together on the bitcoin cash window to open your bch wallet in ledger, check that browser-support = no on the device...toggle between ""use wallet to view"" and ""settings"" then dual-click on settings

then install electroncash.org as follows

check u have the latest version here https://github.com/fyookball/keys-n-hashes/tree/master/sigs-and-sums ... 
file / new-restore / standard / add hardware wallet / ledger / deriv path [145/'0 for the main ledger account

the native electron wallet is called default-wallet, when the ledger connects the second wallet on electron it will be called wallet-1 

after the first connection, installing electron subsequently will remember wallet-1  and take u directly there where u can see the ledger addresses

check that teh funds showing up in the electron screen -bottom left match the funds in your ledger wallet (mius a few cents]

Now u use the electron screen to send / receive to your ledger.
electron cash acts athe front-end to the outside world, so do not send / receive from ledger.


TIPS FOR ESTABLISHING THE CONNECTION

everytime u hit an error on electroncash.org reboot, open the bch wallet with the code even though your timeout period maybe 10 mins

try a different usb slot or a different cable

if new/restore takes u straight into wallet-1  and u can see your ledger main address called ""my account"" inside electron, then the connection is ok, even though u get no confirmation message and even though u cant see you any additional ledger adresses that u may have set up.

if u get the ""install wizard"" dialog when u click new/restore , then click choose to see what wallets u have got. if u see wallet-1 then u should alrteady be connected ... if u can't see the connection then  delete wallet-1 [delete-windows or close-mac] and start again.

if u get the ""install wizard"" dialog , dismiss it and see what wallet you're looking at
default-wallet is the native electron wallet
wallet-1 is the front end wallet for ledger.

TIPS FOR HELPING TX SUCCEED

u can only connect to 1 ledger account at a time. to simplify matters use only myaccount for now.
do not send/receive on the ledger app, rather use electron to send/receive. check that the amount of bch on the bottom left hand side of the electron screen is equal to the amount in ledger's myaccount minus a small fee. 
when u achieve the required integration, electron cas cats teh the front end for ledger to communicate with the outside world.

if u  reset app data...via settings on chrome browser support, click on tools/ reset application data. Next time u go into ledger your bch balance will look like zero. but soon the funds in your main account will show up. ",dtiwe5b,2,1/31/2018 10:33,,,,,,

Fellas, coins don't just go up and up...and up in value. Look at any graph. Stop buying at all time highs.

Was never expecting a moon, but the 2x I was hoping for by Jan 24th-31st seems highly unlikely at this point.

I think the price will only go down as people who bought into ICON recently start panic selling on the 24th.

Wouldn't be shocked to see ICX down to $6.00 before making a slow steady climb to the 2x (and beyond) I was hoping for by early March. Which means, I will be buying more tomorrow :)

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ""We have listened to our community and recognised that more exchanges are necessary as we continue to grow and aim become the first cryptocurrency to achieve real-world mass adoption.
&gt; 
&gt; Since launching at the end of 2017 we have sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency world by quickly gaining 750,000 users, reaching a c.$700m market cap and giving it‚Äôs 120,000 initial contributors up to 2200% returns. Over $513m of ETN has been traded despite only listing on one exchange until now and being live for just over 2 months.
&gt; 
&gt; Our strategy is markedly different from other cryptocurrencies. We have developed a unique mobile mining app, which will allow the coin to become accessible to people all over the world. Users in developing countries can earn ETN by running the app in the background. This airdrop of coins will then be acceptable as payment for their phone data and more. Furthermore, the app will soon feature an easy PayPal-style payment gateway, allowing vendors to accept Electroneum at the touch of a button.
&gt; 
&gt; With the likes of Xius and Effortel, we have partnerships agreed with multinational telecoms corporations in the developing world to make all this a reality, with more expected in the coming weeks. This strategy enables Electroneum to make cryptocurrency available to tens of millions of new users, making it the first truly mass adopted cryptocurrency.
&gt; 
&gt; For you, our community, these developments are made all the more exciting by our listing on [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/?ref_id=5a71c8050039f), where you will have another platform to buy and sell coins.
&gt; 
&gt; You have inspired us with your belief in Electroneum and we‚Äôre excited to be able to reward your patience. [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/?ref_id=5a71c8050039f) is the perfect exchange for us because the team behind it mirror our passion for pushing cryptocurrency to the next level.

ChoosyBeggor,"I love how a log chart managed to make a 40% correction look like the price barely changed.

And by the way, the people posting about bitcoin seem to have no ability to even consider the fundamental drivers of the price. They literally stare at graphs and decide it will keep moving up and to the right.

No, look at the market cap of bitcoin. It would have to be worth 2 trillion dollars to get the same % gain from the previous major high ($1000) to now. If you want to get the same gain as from 2014 low to the peak, then bitcoin cap would have to be worth 13 trillion dollars.

Going from a market cap of $5 million to $50 million is one thing. Going from $160 billion to $13 trillion is another. If bitcoin were worth that much, then it'd be an asset class that take up 2/3 the space that US treasuries take up. That's unfathomable even if Bitcoin had no competition.

The easy growth is over guys, you need to manage your expectations. Bitcoin produces no income, it just sits there, and you hope someone else pays more for it. You'd be better off investing in something that actually creates stuff and grows.

Think about an economy with people investing in two assets.

One economy invests in bitcoins. The other invests in companies. After a hundred years, the bitcoins are still bitcoins. But look at what US companies managed to produce in the past 100 years.

**Edit** There are many logical fallacies being thrown around below. I'll address the most common here:

1. ""That's what they said about bitcoin at $100, $500, $1000, etc."" 

This argument is basically saying that past predictions about the popping of bitcoin's bubble were wrong, therefore, bitcoin's price will go up higher (substantially) in the future. This is not a logically sound argument, it is not at all a reason for why Bitcoin's future price will be higher. Imagine a guy gambling at the roulette table, he puts everything on black, wins, then puts everything on black again, and wins again, etc. His wife keeps telling him to stop because sooner or later he'll lose his money (he's at a mathematical disadvantage in the game). He tells his wife that's what she told him before he won x, y, and z, and therefore, he will continue to win. This reasoning is flawed.

Now this is not to say that bitcoin will not go higher, but if your argument is that past predictions were wrong, therefore the same trend will continue until $x, then you are not making a logical argument and you don't know what you are talking about. And because you don't know what you are talking about, you don't actually know what you are doing, and you're at the mercy of forces and knowledge beyond your comprehension. Be humbled by this fact, not continue to arrogantly and ignorantly repeat ""but the haterz waz wrong b4"".

2. Bitcoin is a great technology that will continue to valuable and adopted in the future, therefore prices will rise. 

This is a better argument but let's say that it is true, what about competition? The first MP3 player was not the iPod, it was something you probably know nothing about. What percentage of the music player market does that first MP3 player have now? What about the first computer? What about the first social media network? The first video hosting website? The first search engine? What percentage of their respective market do they possess?

Blockchain technology is the future. Great. But what percentage of this future will belong to Bitcoin? Bitcoin has been rapidly losing market share to competitors, Ether is now almost 2/3 the size of bitcoin by market cap. So let's say the market cap for crypto coins does ""go to the moon"". Will it be at the expense of bitcoin? Bitcoin no longer lead Ethereum, Ethereum has been on a huge spike these past few weeks, Bitcoin the opposite. Look at what new coins are based on now. Once Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin market cap, there will hardly be any arguments left for Bitcoin being the leader. So what then? Will Bitcoin be the Nokia of the crypto world? Once a powerhouse, and then left with almost no market share? How many technologies can you even name where the first iteration became and remained market leader?",dtiw0ed,2,1/31/2018 10:27,,,,,,

IMO, crypto is the best way anyone can invest any amount of money directly in technology or idea without having to deal with all the roadblocks traditional investing has. Now that I have money to invest I try to find products that have real utility a just let those investment sit for a while.

FirstPaleontologist,"My dumbass? I'm the dumbass that got into ICON at ICO. You can keep your 2400, it is literally a tenth of my stack. The difference between me and you is, that i heard 100 people say the exact same thing to me when I purchased NEO for 3.4cents and Bitcoin for $85. You are no different from the rest of the young professionals that come along and think theat their knowledge of stocks in the stock exchange translates to crypto exchanges.

ICX is worth alot more than $100. Yes I understand market caps, but you obviously do not understand Crypto is a soon to be 7 to 10 trillion dollar market cap, which means market caps for the top 10 tokens will go up alot more than what they are now. 

When I got NEO for 3.4cents do you know how many people told me that it would never reach $35? Let alone $185 the other day?

Just from your statement alone I can tell that you first came to crypto in the month of July or August last year. You spent $300 on ICX because you were the dumbass who had more money to spend but you were to dumb to purchase anything more than $300. Whereas people like me purchased 8 ETH worth of it on my account and 30 ETH on my wifes account. We spent this because we are all too well aware of what ICX will become. 
How about you make a better bet with me? How about we use a smart contract and we both enter into the smart contract a bet. I will put in 20,000 ICX and you put your 2400 ICX in. and if any point between now and December 31st that ICX hits $100 USD, I get it all and if it does not hit it, then you get it all. 
Put your money where your mouth is. I offer this to you and you alone. 

Jesus christ. It hit $12 in 3 weeks and you do not think it can go up 10x that in 12 months. You are obviously very very new to the crypto game. My guess is you must post here alot too so just know that anything you say here on out, people who ahve been in the crypto game for a while will not pay you any attention thinking that ICX will not go to $100. You obviously do not even understand what ICX is if you think  it can not reach $100. I suppose you do not think Ethereum will be trading at $3400 this year either. You Sir are the dumbass. Let's be honest, if you were smarter you would have a shit load more than a pissy 2400 ICX and if your reasoning for only buying that amount is because you did not get it at ICO, then that just proves you were to dumb to buy it at ICO and if your point is it was because you were not in crypto already, then that just goes to prove that you are still the dumbass who did not get into crypto when the bitcoin whitepaper first made its appearance in the media . Not interested in 100 ICX. I will be up for a bet where you stake your 2400 ICX and everything else in the same wallet that you have that in.

As a developer, cryptocurrency - the entire market - I just see so much potential. It's all open source. The communities are welcoming.

DeStagiair,"Een kleine opmerking: de meeste cryptomunten bieden geen anonimiteit , maar pseudonimiteit. Dit geld ook voor bitcoin.

Bij anonimiteit kan dit niet en er zijn maar een aantal munten dit wel bieden, zoals Monero.

En als je heel pedantisch bent over de betekenis van het woord anoniem kun je ook zeggen dat zelfs Monero niet anoniem is, omdat je nog steeds je priv√© sleutel als 'identiteit' hebt. ",dtivsq8,2,1/31/2018 10:23,,,,,,

frankly I'm surprised its taking this long, but then again there is a lot of stupid money who still think BTC is still in a bull market.

when a bubble bursts, the market turns bear and the price slowly bleeds out until you find the real bottom months later.

same thing is happening to ETH, its just happening on delay 

I know everyone here is jerking each other off about how the flipping is happening because ETH isn't bleeding as hard as Bitcoin. But the ETH price has been bleeding out for a few weeks now. 

Essentially ETH right now is where BTC was at $15,000. Where Bitcoiners were saying ""its just a dip, it'll go up any day now"" and laughing at weak hands who sold. And as you can see by the current BTC price, there is still plenty of room for it to fall down

**Author**:  _tke1600_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;I write this as Bitcoin is down again from more headlines that aren't even something really happening again. It seems like the masses are again falling for the same mainstream media tricks of click bait and drama about ""what could happen if X"".  Obviously it has worked as we've seen Bitcoin now drop 50% since it's ATH and about $7,000 just in the past few weeks.  

&gt;When you look at the timeline of events that have caused this huge drop, it is almost 100% because of click bait headlines, ""announcements"" from officials that didn't ever come to anything, or conspiracy theories that if even wore proven 100% correct, wouldn't really have the significant impact.

&gt;Can we make a list that separates reality from hypothetical situations that are not real?

&gt;Here is my first ""real event"" that has any merit:  

&gt;Overblown projects that people fomo'd into after huge marketing pushes got slaughtered after they didn't live up to expectations quick enough.  This has caused all coins to drop in some fashion most likely. ",dtivm5a,2,1/31/2018 10:20,,,,,,
Quicksilver,"It's only a waste of dinosaurs and trees based on the assumption of it having no use or value.   There's basically not an industry out there that doesn't consume power. This one consumes basically just power and creates the product directly... new coins and validated transactions.  Crypto mining consuming power is actually a good thing.  Unlike fiat currency there is an unavoidable cost about the creation of each unit so the government or some other entity can't just create more, devaluing yours, easily or cheaply.  The electricity also isn't just ""wasted"" either.  It is used to solve difficult problems that ensure protection against fraud in crypto transactions.  To make a fraudulent transaction you would have to control more than 50% of the network power (bitcoin) which as of a couple of years ago was already HUNDREDS of times the computing power of Google.

To illustrate: Bitcoin does not close partnerships with businesses or government agencies. Who would even have to sign these documents? Bitcoin does not apply for exchange listings. Bitcoin does not hold conferences where a team tells you what is going to happen next. Sure there are conferences, but then it is just developers talking about what they are working on. They cannot tell you if their code will ever be adopted by the network. Because of this decentralization, Bitcoin progresses in a rather inefficient manner.

The first experience is to show the benefit of strong 2FA. the power of an isolated seed key protected by hardware to assure the seed can not be stolen and then also provide the backup, recovery and information assurance it is operating as expected. The goal is to provide this without any additional user annoyance.  It is a start as we move to more sophisticated controls.

Scagnettio,"Tether doesn't hold bitcoin, they hold dollars. If they printed more usdt then dollars handed to them they pumped the whole market. If everyone would cash out of the exchanges into real dollars tether would be bankrupt and the exchanges would owe their customers a large amount of dollars. 

No way the exchange can say, sorry usdt went down so we can't give you any dollars. They would either be able to repay customers from their own revenue or they would go bankrupt. Many exchanges need some form of token representing a dollar, so either they peg a own token to the dollar. They hold 1:1 token to dollar on their own books or they enact direct dollar trading with the regulatory issues that come with it. Which, at this point would require an enormous buffer. This also means that this token would likely not be traded on different exchanges because trust in the entities making the tokens (in this particular case the exchanges themselves) would be gone. 

The only thing I see how tether currently fails is if the country in which they operate gets pressured by the USA to seize business under some sort of weird interpretation of a anti-counterfeit law.

tyzbit,"&gt;crypto is fiat

False. Some crypto is. These are known as shitcoins. Others are created according to consensus rules. These are not fiat because by definition, fiat is derived from authority, not consensus. Bitcoin is an example of a cryptocurrency that the money is not created via imposed authority, but by agreement in common consensus rules.

For example, what are the rules to Blackjack? Who determines these rules? The answers are the rules vary slightly but are largely similar between players and the players themselves agree on common rules. There is no imposition of authority. Since Blackjack doesn't have other properties that cryptocurrency have, as a result there are things like cheating and incompatible rules. That doesn't happen with properly designed cryptocurrencies because no participant would agree to rules that would be used to cheat them.",dtivbtm,2,1/31/2018 10:16,,,,,,

yyertles,"&gt; you cannot compare it to stocks like that

Why not? We're talking about different asset classes, what's wrong with pointing out the differences? People do it all the time with equity vs. debt. You were the one who initially likened crypto to long term dividend investing in the first place. 
 
Is it a new asset class? Sure, to an extent. But it also functions pretty similarly to traditional asset classes like fiat or gold, especially for coins with no practical application like bitcoin. 
 
&gt;thus creating value
 
Sure, but that value accrues to the developers/owners of the eventual IP, not to the coin. That would be like saying that buying a keyboard is the same as buying stock in IBM because the engineers at IBM use keyboards to write code. 
 
Again, I'm not saying there is no value, just that it is fundamentally different than investing in a stock. I can see a use case where new companies could actually use some form of cryptocurrency to capitalize by distributing equity with crypto as a vehicle, but that isn't what is happening.

&gt; Now that the bubble has officially burst, it's important that you know this wasn't your fault - AND YOU ARE NOT STUPID FOR BELIEVING THE HYPE / MEME!
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, a few months ago everyone dreamed of their dreams coming true. Everyone was buying the ""bitcoin will topple USD as the global reserve currency"", and people actually (genuinely) thought cryptocurrency was ""a revolution"" *(lol)*. 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, all of that was bullshit. It was just a way to lure in money from unknowing fools looking to get rich quick in order to pump the price further. 
&gt; 
&gt; The bubble is obviously bursting as we speak. Most bitcoiners act like it's ""just another correction"", but you shouldn't take this crash lightly; BTC has lost over half its value, and that has not happened many times before. In fact, this crash is worse and went much faster than the 2013-2014 crash, which resulted in a multi-year bear market and saw bitcoin's price plummet over 85%! 
&gt; 
&gt; I highly recommend selling now if you bought recently. Even if you bought at $15k or higher. This will go down much more. Bitcoin's price is, in fact, a bubble. There is nothing holding it up and there's nothing to justify this ridiculous price. That's why it also crashed so much so quickly; if only a few large holders sell, the price will plummet and slaughter everyone in its way. 
&gt; 
&gt; Just think about it; one bitcoin, a digital token which is easily stolen if you're not a maniac about security, was worth almost $20,000! $20k... For most people, even in the developed and wealthy First World Countries, that's a year's worth of labour! And most don't even have that in savings after having worked their ass off for a decade, day-in day-out, for thousands of days and nights.

mc_schmitt,"Jack from r/QRL

The security industry *is* concerned about Quantum Computing. Just not cryptocurrency for some reason. For example: 

- NSA no longer recommends 256 ECDSA since 2015 (what bitcoin uses)
- Google has been testing Quantum Resistant algorithms in its browser since 2016  
- NIST is evaluating Post Quantum algorithms...

QRL follows that trend and our Discord reflects that with the amount of security professionals in it. Some are taking courses on Quantum Computing (ie. Microsoft released Q#, IBM has QSKit etc) as well. With Quantum Supremacy happening this year (almost happened last year with IBM's 50 qubit computer), it's a good time to get in on a ground floor opportunity here. 

Bottom line in relation to cryptocurrency is it's going to be much easier to become Post Quantum Resistant with centralized systems, but a cryptocurrency needs to be QR from genesis 'lest you end up with a fork where half your wallets are insecure. You can't *simply add* quantum resistance later without a fork.

You might want to check out [Quantum Attacks on bitcoin, and how to protect against them](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf). It covers everything from the gate speed progression, accuracy and qubits to what vectors would be used to attack bitcoin. It's also not affiliated with QRL - so is less biased in that way.

keymone,"&gt; Why fast sync is a similar compromise than regular Bitcoin node. They also don‚Äôt check the whole history from the beginning by default

except *they do*. only spv wallets don't.

&gt; When both is not possible, which one is preferable

obviously a tradeoff must be made.

&gt; that was enough for people fighting to keep the 1MB

that wasn't the reason people were fighting to keep 1mb, eventual centralization was (and still is).

&gt; Getting a payment while in flight? Too bad.

if that is such a problem for you - outsource payment collection into hosted hot wallet for the 1% of your life that you're not online. it's a bullshit argument.

&gt; I certainly don‚Äôt welcome the day nodes are too expensive to in cheap computer

well, with BCH you're one (if not many) steps closer. going for the last resort scaling solution before investing reasonable effort into second layer - *that* is reckless.

&gt; why it is best to force low requirements to run nodes if it hurt decentralisation

it's a dishonest statement. i already told you the goal is not to force low requirements but to keep the growth of requirements from spiralling out of control.

&gt; Other nodes have no say on the network: zero

they do - they decide which blocks are valid for propagation and which transactions are valid for propagation.

&gt; A below $80 can mean two weeks waiting or no confirmation ever.

market will pay what market will pay. if price is too high - demand will drop and price will go down. it's simple.

&gt; Bitcoin need a shit load of high to support PoW on 1MB

you have it backwards, bitcoin fees are high because everybody wants to transact there.

&gt; You are right none of those link show support for $1000 fee

nor for $100.

thank you for admitting you're wrong even if only half-heartedly.

&gt; Those link certainly show the BTC crowd is very high fees friendly, aren‚Äôt you not?

i cannot parse that sentence.. i'm not high-fee friendly, i'm market-friendly.

&gt; Are you ok with $100 fees?

i'm fine with market fees. i don't think 1mb is the perfect number. i also don't think that because we don't think 1mb is perfect number, we can experiment wildly with one of the most important projects in human history.

Ver's argument that ""blocks were always unlimited"" is pure marketing bullshit, it's like saying roads can always support unlimited traffic only because we never see them 100% jammed. investing in more efficient modes of transportation is preferable to adding more and more lanes.",dtiuwbg,2,1/31/2018 10:08,,,,,,

jonald_fyookball,"
Thanks for the positive comments.  

I'd like to address a few of the concerns.

First, I don't see that Electron Cash is going
to be utilizing any patented tech for the foreseeable
future.  The 3 projects I'd like to prioritize
are a better android version, an iOS version,
and a feature phone (Nokia) version... so that
everyone on the planet can use this wallet.

There has been some discussion of Dr. Wright's
""blinded signatures"", which may be patented,
but I think it is best to leave that out of
the main client for a few reasons, and
let the CashShuffle people (or others)
develop that as a plugin if they wish.

Even if there is some patented piece of
technology that finds its way into Electron
Cash in the future, the project is easily 
forkable at any point prior, as it is 
currently under the MIT lisence.  

I will have to look into what lisences
will be used for new development (for
example iOS), as the intention is that
the funding benefit Bitcoin Cash and
not other coins...however a valid point
was raised about what happens if in
the future there is another chain split.

So that is something to think about.

I understand we must always be vigilant
about avoiding another 'Blockstream capture'.
I think it is less of a concern with an 
SPV client like Electron Cash versus
a full node software because SPV is going
to have to follow what the miners are doing.

I could tell you that I have a high
level of belief that nChain is beneficient,
or that I would refuse funding if I suspected
anything nefarious (both true), 
but those sentiments are irrelevant to the
concerns, because at the end of the day,
anyone can choose to become a bad actor.  

What's the solution?

In the long term, I think that education
is the only way to avoid more ""UASF"" type
situations, brigading, and undue influencing
of the miners.

Remember, the last thing ""they"" want is a well
informed, well educated populace... conversely,
this is the ultimate weapon to keeping peer to
peer electronic cash alive and well.  And
this is why I've made efforts with writing
articles and such.

frisian2,"&gt;  Bitcoin e.d. belooft niemand een hoog rendement

Idd, niemand belooft hoge rendementen met cryptocurrency, misschien had ik het geen piramidespelletje moeten noemen maar beter ""een situatie die op een piramidespelletje lijkt"". Want er zijn wel degelijk genoeg mensen die de hoge winsten zien en denken dat de koek niet op kan. (en aangezien er geen werkelijk product is en de enige winst van nieuwe ""beleggers"" komt mag je dus wel spreken van een situatie die lijkt op een piramidespelletje).

Ja ik ben me tevens van bewust dat de grootste coins voornamelijk op exchanges wordt verhandeld die zich op dit moment netjes aan de wet houden maar op dit moment zijn er helaas nog te veel cowboys en is extra regulering wel degelijk handig. 

Ik ben al een paar maanden terug afgehaakt met het dieper kijken naar crypto aangezien het mij toen al duidelijk was dat het niets meer is dan een op een pyramidespelletje lijkende bubbel waarbij de enige winst bij nieuwe beleggers vandaan komt. ",dtitpk7,2,1/31/2018 9:49,,,,,,
shmorky,"&gt;  enige waarde achter cryptocurrency is het feit dat het de anonimiteit bied voor criminele doeleinden, zodra een cryptocurrency zoals bitcoin en de daarbij behorende trading platformen zich aan de wet gaan houden dan zit er geen enkele waarde meer aan het product.

Aah. Het bekende criminelen &lt;3 crypto-argument. Ik zie dat je nog in 2015 leeft. Ik zal ook even een duit in het zakje doen.

De waarde van een bank bestaat voor een groot deel uit het wegnemen van de noodzaak je geld zelf te beschermen. Als je je loon enkel in contanten uitbetaald zou krijgen moet je het weer in een kluis of onder je matras leggen, wat natuurlijk een gigantisch risico is als je wat spaargeld hebt. Voor het overgrote deel van de klanten van een bank is dit, in combinatie met het bestaan van pinautomaten zo'n beetje het enige criteria voor het hebben van een bankrekening. Cryptocurrency zijn opgeslagen in de blockchain. Alleen jij hebt toegang (als je de boel een beetje beveiligd), dus een bankrekening heb je eigenlijk niet meer nodig.

Verder is ook de transactie-markt (Western Union e.d.) in 1 klap overbodig. Met crypto kun je tegen een fractie van de prijs geld de hele wereld over sturen. Bijna instant. Zolang je het in het land van aankomst maar om kunt zetten in een lokale munt. En ook dat zou niet eens meer hoeven als je je crypto gewoon in de supermarkt kunt besteden. Dat laatste is overigens enkel een kwestie van tijd. Tot de cryptomarkt een beetje stabiliseert en er wat solide betaaldiensten komen (zoals iDeal of de PIN-dienst).

Trouwens, al dat geld dat jij op je bankrekening hebt wordt ook al enkele tientallen jaren niet meer gedekt. Amerika en Europa geven geld uit dat ze zelf uitgevonden hebben. Een beetje vergelijkbaar met hoe minen werkt. Zolang iedereen er maar aan mee blijft doen bestaat het voort. Het is allemaal gestold vertrouwen wat evengoed kan verdampen als men het vertrouwen verliest.

Edit: ik vergeet nog dat veel cryptomunten een secundair nut hebben, zoals Ethereum en NEO die te gebruiken zijn om contracten vast te leggen en te valideren (doei notarissen) of IOTA dat de IoT-netwerkstandaard wil zijn. En zo zijn er nog talloze anderen. Velen zullen ook weer afvallen, maar er komt een dag in de niet al te verre toekomst dat alle uitkristalliseert.",dtitpjt,2,1/31/2018 9:49,,,,,,

Since the Aureus Bitcoin Trust (ABT) reserve has been liquidated, AureusCentral's initial purpose for pledging is no longer active.
Therefore, all users should eventually move their AURS to their Aureus.cc wallets. 

We would like to sincerely apologise for the mishap that has occurred with some transactions over the past week. This is due to the fact that our system is going through some changes and there was an issue with the database.

The exchanges almost all use Tether, it would be a disaster if Tether crashed, because this would also crash Bitcoin and subsequently the whole crypto market would drop maybe 75%. The exchanges would never allow this to happen, so what will they do?   1: If the exchanges believe that TETHER is a fraud they will start delisting USDT. I imagine they will do this if Tether cannot prove that it has enough USDT to back its funds. Situation 2: The Exchanges back Tether (much more likely in my opinion) and even if Tether cannot prove its total holdings they will continue using it because Bitfinex is the primary backer of Tether and Bitfinex is currently the king of crypto exchanges. They have the highest volume of trades of all exchanges, they have survived a significant hack, they have the most professional crypto trading platform in existence. If an exchange delisted USDT they would be standing against Bitfinex which would be very foolish because Bitfinex is currently the most powerful exchange and can strike back harder in other ways.

DCinvestor,"Markets eventually realize fundamental value and utility.  Especially when it is derived from real world usage, increasing functionality, and difficult to replicate network effects.

Ethereum clearly has all of these, and they will only strengthen during 2018.  Developer and user network effects are multiplying rapidly.  And network functionality and capacity could grow by orders of magnitude.

Bitcoin used to have some of these characteristics, but let's face facts: it does not anymore.  It is difficult to sustain a network effect without actual / growing usage.  Lightning and Rootstock don't appear to be providing the answer either.  It's harsh to say that it's just another store of value coin, but at least it was the first.

""Store of value"" is a narrative that was created when BTC stopped being used regularly peer to peer, due to rising fees.  What you see these markets starting to say right now is that they care about utility, not about marketing narratives.

britcruise,"yeah totally I've read all that too. I agree. So when making Bitcoin you had two choices for the supply:

a. just make it fixed, no gov control - simple. we know that ""works""

b. have some sort of variable supply that is controlled collectively by a community vote...etc etc. (more complex, no need to do this).

I guess I'm not saying it's one is ""more important"", but ""what should you explain first"" to people. because they already (kinda) know and understand non-gov fixed supply via Gold.

Also I'm finding that to explain fiat properly, I have to do a 10min detour through monetary history (leading to china fiat), and so it takes a while for people to really get it. (and why we might want to have a non-gov fixed supply). And so that's in the body of the video.

So the call to action at the opening, anyone can understand:

1. your online money is 100% censored, and restricted to those with bank accounts.

and then clarify that

1b. your fiat money (physical OR digital) is only as good as the behind it, and can lead to catastrophe (always happens when you look at history)

and so that requires
1. a non government money
2. which works natively online (has no physical form)

 &gt;So my wife and I have decided to go crypto only.  We are trying to do a tactical approach to this and are budgeting and living around current market trends.  

&gt;I subscribed to amazon prime/amazon pantry, and a shift card three months ago(we started with litecoin then switched to bch when coinbase supported it for the shift card). We are buying groceries and other essentials online with our shift card on upswings. And we buy more bitcoin cash on downswings and don't spend and just live off the amazon pantry groceries when its going down.
Once a month or so bitcoin cash will have a major spike, so we usually load up on the majority of groceries during this time period.

britcruise,"Yes good point. bare with me here. The tough part is getting the ordering right when laying this out for people because you have two sides to this:

A. having money with a flexible supply controlled by trusted 3rd party (fiat) vs. money with fixed supply which isn't controlled by anyone (gold is 'naturally rare' bitcoin is 'provably rare')

B. the need for digital cash of ANY kind (uncensorable &amp; open access) regardless of how the supply works.

I'd argue that B is the primary goal of Bitcoin, and it's the reason for bitcoin as described by Satoshi...and those before him. Their ""call to action"" wasn't to ""move people off fiat"" it was to 'exchange value directly over a communication line'

it just so happens that in order to make b possible you necessarily have to invent A (new money with fixed supply, which is 'naturally rare'..etc.)

And I've noticed when explaining this to the average skeptic (cab driver) you have to remind them that there isn't anything WRONG with having fiat money. We aren't trying to stop it or kill the government...etc. (which is why people try to dismiss this as libertarian fantasy). Instead you need to carefully lay it out as ""we are missing a choice"" of not using it online.

So I'm thinking this whole 'non-government' money with fixed supply is a 'feature' of Bitcoin but not the point of it. 

This is why I'm careful to say ""physical cash"" (no matter the form) because whether you use gold or paper fiat, it's the same thing. UNLESS you are talking about storing wealth (that's when you care about supply)

And the whole store of wealth angle, is another 'feature' of Bitcoin that wasn't really part of the initial goal either.

Just_Trying2Help,"I want to talk about this but think you may be barking up the wrong path here. Your assumption is that Tether Inc. is printing Tether for 100% profit and just keeping the BTC or whatever. But that is not what evidence shows or how a good scam would run. We have had people claiming to be institutional investors with Tether and the reason they do it is not as an onramp for USD into crypto, what they are doing is ""lending"" USD to Tether to then lend USDT out from margin trading on the exchanges. So from the instatutional investors point of view they just see that they get 0.02% a day interest ""lending to Tether"". 

Does this make more sense for the current Tether situation? The fear in this case would be that if Tether price falls investors will pull their money at a loss, be very angry, and tank the liquidity for margin trading. I think crypto prices could go wait way after this, no reason Eth would go.down or up necessarily.

As someone who is a scientist who studies cryptos, I am telling you, specifically, in finance, no one calls dodgecoins bitcoins. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""bitcoin family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of SHA-256-based cryptocurrencies, which includes things from fatcom to titcoin to factom.

So your reasoning for calling a dodgecoin a bitcoin is because random people ""call the digital stuff bitcoins?"" Let's get Amazon Gift Cards and online poker tokens in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A dodgecoin is a jackdaw and a member of the cryptocurrencies family.

However, I still think this is how the system ought to work. If they are genuinely able to handicap Bitcoin so much so with only 18% of hashing power, and this is really enough to push people to BCash, then maybe Bitcoin isn't robust enough.

Of course, I honestly don't think this is realistic. But for the sake of argument, and on principle, if they're able to break confidence / reduce usage of Bitcoin so easily, it probably isn't the trustless, permissionless, system we're looking for.

In reality though, I don't think this is AntPool's game plan, or I think they really would be doing empty blocks, and they'd probably be coercing / paying other miners / pools to do the same to really handicap Bitcoin to the point that no one can get a transaction through.

Ant-n,"&gt;&amp;gt; even if that lead to less (?) nodes

&gt;it doesn't, it leads to sustainable network connectivity. eth nodes can't be compared to btc nodes because they don't do the same work.

Why fast sync is a similar compromise than regular Bitcoin node. They also don‚Äôt check the whole history from the beginning by default.

You have an idea how much hash power you have to produce to fake a sync node with a modified history?

It is basically a 51% attack.. with that much hash power you can attack full node just as easily as a sync node.

&gt;&amp;gt; Does node decentralisation come from the number of nodes available or the ability to run a low cost of running a node

&gt;both, obviously.

When both is not possible, which one is preferable?

A large number of nodes (because they are more useful but take more resources) or cheap nodes but less of them.

&gt;&amp;gt; I am talking about LN channel and why there is a fundamental difference between LN channel and with BTC nodes.

&gt;you were talking that LN nodes ""need routing"", but when i pointed out that they don't and just broadcast their presence you started talking how it's bad that LN nodes broadcast data even though you obviously know that bitcoin nodes *also* do a lot of broadcasting.

Well they both broadcast.

Interestingly with very similar scaling properties.

&gt;&amp;gt; users hate always online system

&gt;then you have nothing to worry about. LN will die in flames and will be forgotten. why are people on this sub so obsessed with details of LN implementation?

I am not threatened by LN.

I think it is a great tool and I welcome its implementation on BCH. It will likely have specific use case where it will be unbeatable. I had some hope it would work great for microtransactions.. but unfortunately the always online constraints might prevent most of those uses..

What I hate is people arguing that LN can do all (scale to thousands/millions tps) and that was enough for people fighting to keep the 1MB. That was reckless and led to Bitcoin splitting.

&gt;&amp;gt; That will limit LN usage, this is not FUD. It is fact

&gt;well i have no problem with statement like that, but that's a sharply different tone to your suggestions that LN won't work at all because of that limitation. *that's* a FUD and it's widespread on this sub.

I have never argued LN can‚Äôt work because of that.

&gt;&amp;gt; LN wallet on your phone can receive payment for example, because a phone can be always internet on.

&gt;somebody is still living in 90s? my phone has internet connection 24/7.

Well if you travel a bit, it can get near impossible to have 24/7 on a phone.

Getting a payment while in flight? Too bad.

&gt;&amp;gt; why it best to force low requirements for nodes if it reduces decentralisation

&gt;you haven't addressed my actual comment at all. point was how forcing low cost participants creates a feedback loop that converges on all participants being big corporations with extremely expensive hardware. try again.

Certainly node can go in the high 100MB block before nodes need be run by server farm. That mean there is a potential one maybe two order of magnitude grow possible.

It remain to be discussed what is more resilient/preferable:

A network with few nodes running on small blocks, or a network running very large block that requires expensive hardware to run but with cheap transactions and huge user base and many nodes run in many countries and the currency being so huge and so ubiquitous than government cannot attack it without hurting themselves due to loss business or peoples revolts.

I certainly don‚Äôt welcome the day nodes are too expensive to in cheap computer, but if that can lead to a larger, stronger network overall and it is the price to pay to disrupt the current financial system, so be it.


&gt;&amp;gt; why it best to force low requirements for nodes if it reduces decentralisation

Now maybe you can reply to my question, why it is best to force low requirements to run nodes if it hurt decentralisation?

Can you see than it is not black and white and allowing more capacity, use case can lead to more nodes, also?

&gt;&amp;gt; The philosophy of cheap nodes don‚Äôt make sense to me

&gt;it's not about cheap, it's about not allowing the cost to reach escape velocity, where all nodes are controlled by big corps.

Nodes are already controlled by corps.

Miner, exchange.

Other nodes have no say on the network: zero. Remember UASF, it was all about getting the ‚Äúeconomic‚Ä?node to support it. Why? Because that the only nodes that can influence the network.

Small or large block the situation is the same.




&gt;&amp;gt; is there enough demand for BTC tx to fill a block wth +$80 tx fees?

&gt;first, you seem to misunderstand how fees work. if i'm unwilling to pay $80 then i have the option to pay $40 and wait longer or just wait and pay less later, because dropping demand will drop transaction fees.

There is only so much space in 1MB.

A below $80 can mean two weeks waiting or no confirmation ever.

I had a $8 fees BTC tx that took more than two to confirm..

(Not good BTW for LN.. closing tx are time critical)

&gt;second, you have simplistic view of sustainability. it's not just about whether people will want to continue to pay the price for being on chain, it's also about whether miners will want to mine the chain. when halfening happens BTC is suffering less because miners' losses are offset by fees. that's *better* sustainability.

Miner will always mine the chain as long as it is profitable to do so.

If there is not enough fee to collect miner leaves and difficulty drop, if fees are too low difficulty can drop to dangerous level.

Bitcoin need a shit load of high to support PoW on 1MB.

&gt;&amp;gt; From that link

&gt;lie number one.

&gt;Adam's tweet was in response to a guy saying that people would pay $20 for secure ledger like bitcoin. Adam's response was that *he would pay $100*, though it would be nice if fees were smaller.

&gt;there is literally no way to misconstrue that tweet so that it means ""i'm looking forward to $100 fees"".

&gt;lie number two.

from that greg's email:

&gt;&amp;gt; I'd also personally prefer to pay lower fees-- current levels even
challenge my old comparison with wire transfer costs-- but we should
look most strongly at difficult to forge market signals rather than
just claims--

&gt;so again, not a hint of ""looking forward to pay $1000"".

&gt;either admit that you're mistaken about their position or just quit lying if you're doing that on purpose.

You are right none of those link show support for $1000 fee, I cannot seems to find the link I am thinking about.

Many core have a habit of deleting their old messages on this sub, really annoying. 

it might have been removed.

DaddyLittlePrincess8,"25%BTC/25%ETH/50%Alts here

In my opinion, BTC now looks horrifically slow in development terms because of the speed of other dev teams. One of bitcoin's remaining strengths is its decentralization of development. This makes it:

- Slow to reach consensus
- Rigorously tested

The debacle of Segwit2x was not resolved quickly or painlessly. I think its obvious that a lot of people would rather we did have a small block size increase to tide us over till lightning. Now, the fire is right up the ass of BTC to get the product working without any sort of block size increase.

Given that many people were talking about Lightning never happening and now in the space of a week we've got a testnet of thousands I think some of the 'BTC isn't doing anything to rectify its problems' argument starts to lose a little bit of steam.

ETH deserves to catch up BTC as their rate of development has been phenomenal. I think their recent dApp fiasco demonstrates that ETH isn't immune to growing pains however. 

To answer your question, the bitcoin community does want these standards/processes, but the current attitude is that off-chain scaling needs to be the way forward and that it must be absolutely flawless in its implementation.

I know these rates aren't typical of most credit card processors, but we're required to have a high risk merchant account due to the nature of our products.  

&gt;Since bitcoin doesn't charge monthly/annual fees or take a percentage of each sale, we pass those savings onto our customers. The business is new, so any feedback is greatly appreciated. We're listed on spendabit.co too.

Right now the price per GH is 2.20 on Hashflare or .00022154 BTC

BTC Current Value - 9888

.00022154*9888 = 2.19058752

It is slightly cheaper to reinvest right now.

Plus the value of daily compounding and dollar cost averaging outweighs the fluctuations in price&gt; Hash power is hash power and Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Forget the USD value while in the mining contract and focus on producing the most Bitcoin with your investment.

It's apparent they still don't believe Ripple and XRP will be successful in the future.  Even at $3, that is a steal, yet they complain after just one month XRP is dead and not made them millions.

RISE hit $1.45 and is now .56 cents.  Bitcoin, god of all crypto, hit $19,932 and was $9,976 yesterday. And i could go on and on with every other crypto.

Get out of XRP.  Leave this circle jerk.  No one is begging you to stay.  And XRP and it's hodlers don't need you to succeed.  XRP is selling itself.  People test drive cars before they buy them.  Banks will pilot XRP before they use it.  Trials and pilots equals interest.  If I have not interest in a Dodge, I'm not stopping by a Dodge dealership.  That simple.

And they are heading down the right path with all the interest and pilots.  But its not going to happen over night.  Or even in a month from the time you bought between $2-3.  You either believe in what Ripple is doing or you don't.  Believers hodl and ride the bad with the good.

&gt; ***Re: [PATCH] increase block size limit***

&gt; ***October 04, 2010, 07:48:40 PM***

&gt; It can be phased in, like:

&gt; if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)

&gt; maxblocksize = largerlimit

&gt; It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.

&gt; When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.

Tether the organization is only underwater if they don't have $2.3 Billion of crypto in their reserves. Depending on their weighted average purchase price they may actually have $2.3 Billion of combined Bitcoin and USD in their reserves.

Person A then sends credit card deposit to account in name of person B, flips it into Eth, and promptly withdraws. Then person A charges back the deposit as an unauthorised transaction. Credit card deposit for crypto purchase is a nightmare, and there's a reason every man and his dog don't like credit card purchases in the crypto space. I'm fine with this 4%. I'm also fine with the $20 withdrawal fee.

However, 0.01 Eth withdrawal fee is nuts, that's over $10, and quite unreasonable, and the Bitcoin withdrawal fee is also too high.

This absolutely has an effect on Ethereum &amp; the market as a whole - because ultimately bitcoin is still King. The ""flippening"" won't come, in my opinion, from Ethereum gaining huge value. It'll come from bitcoin dropping, the market dropping with it, and Ethereum being able to simply hold it's ground better (but still dropping).

cryptostorage,"##Introduction

I'm pleased to announce [cryptostorage.com](https://cryptostorage.com).

cryptostorage.com is an open-source tool to create offline storage for multiple cryptocurrencies.  This tool generates [key pairs](https://cryptostorage.com/#faq_key_pair) in your device's browser which can store cryptocurrency without exposing private keys to an internet-connected device.  Generated key pairs can be easily printed and saved to digital files for long-term storage.

This tool is security-focused.  Funds are never entrusted to a third party.  Private keys can be passphrase-protected and [split into pieces](https://cryptostorage.com/#faq_split_keys) which can be geographically separated so funds are not accessible at any one location.

""The tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories."" - google definition

Explanation: 
Past performance of a market has no impact on future performance. 

Further Explanation: 
Buying and selling on a market are done (essentially by humans, or humans controlling bots, etc), therefore to convince someone to buy or to sell the stock, currency, etc there has to be an exterior motivator for this. I gave two examples that in my mind are indicators of motivation to bring people into a market and two that would motivate people to exit their position with some links for people reading to follow along, these links are just what i like reading, and i suggest you find reliable sources of information for yourself, DO NOT BE A SHEEP, create your own opinion and stick to it.

Examples:

-1: There is a new announcement for your favorite project that a major milestone has been achieved, increasing general confidence in the currency attracting more people to buy in, increasing the price of said currency.

https://www.stellar.org/blog/2018-Stellar-Roadmap/

-2: There is a new partnership introduced that will shortly bring real world value to the currency you are currently working on, an example of this is News that Stellar would be used as the digital currency for Starbucks ( hypothetical, this has not happened.)

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-trusted-digital-currency-is-coming-but-its-not-bitcoin-says-starbucks-howard-schultz-2018-01-26

-3: There are multiple exchanges that are getting audited, stolen from and experiencing suspicious behavior ( read: bitfinex, tether, coincheck, bitgrail), creating enough fear to surpass some people's fear threshold, and leading to many people selling their position resulting in a bear market.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc

https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7u2x97/bitgrail/

http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/29/technology/coincheck-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-japan/index.html

-4: For mystical reasons for which you cannot understand, Bitcoin/Ethereum just crashed down quickly losing 20% of total market value over a span of a few days, this is enough to scare the crap out of a person who just maxed out their visa/student loan/ life savings or just invested a significant sum of money(NEVER PUT DOWN MONEY YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE) Which starts network effect that quickly signals to people that they should probably sell to avoid massive losses, generating a huge drop in the market.

Later on you will figure out that this could possibly be explained: Chinese new year, tax season, announcement that Korean exchanges might enact new policies,etc), and for whatever reason the market re-asserts itself, blah blah blah.

According to the minister ""our"" collective thoughts head in the same direction about measures being desirable but that it will have to be tested.

The minister hopes to be able to inform the government within weeks from now.


Hoekstra has been warning for longer allready against the Bitcoin. The Dutch financial market authority (Autoriteit Financi√´le Markten) and the Dutch Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank) also warn about the risks involved. Despite all warnings Dutch investors still are investing, the minister concludes.""

It might be clear governments worldwide are trying to slay their 'nemesis', or atleast keeping the cryptomarket as small and regulated as possible.",dtiq3b6,2,1/31/2018 8:45,,,,,,

In 10 years, encryption may fail and something new will have to come out.  Maybe bitcoin will adapt, maybe it won't.  Maybe it won't even be 3 coins but 70,000 coins with lots and lots of exchanges?

Maybe Walmart employees will be paid with Walmart coin and Walmart will stop taking cash and credit cards, so the employees will exchange Walmart coin for ShellGasCoin and AmazonCoin and KrogersCoin?  Maybe the entire idea of independent public blockchains will die because private blockchains will take over.

Nobody knows.

This is why I suggest doing the following:

* Stop spending on bullshit like video games, netflix, expensive sneakers, fast food
* Put all your excess income into a basket of goods, like:
* 7% crypto
* 6% liquid savings, high yield
* 6% CD ladder
* 25% stocks
* 25% bullion
* 25% real estate or REIT dividend yielding vehicles

And stop worrying about how much you didn't make when the last 10 years of your life were about buying throwaway bullshit that made assholes like me rich.

If you stop spending money on useless crap, what you invest in doesn't matter.

Gold and bitcoin are different, in that the supply of bitcoin is **inelastic**. When demand for gold goes up, the rate that gold is mined also goes up, which puts a damper on the price increase (because the supply of gold increases faster than before). That can't happen with bitcoin, since mining rate is the same regardless of demand for bitcoin.

Your best option is just to shop around to various CC processors. 2.75% isn't an *awful* rate, but you can probably get lower (I think we're paying like 2.1 - 2.2% right now?

JobDestroyer,"&gt;BTW that wire transfer, had it been the Nth wire transfer for X amount, triggers a report to the Feds.

The way Bitcoin works is that it makes all this information public, only pseudonymous. If Coinbase, for instance, reveals where transactions were sent, it's very easy for the government to look at that and figure out which addresses belong to whom. Both wire transfers and bitcoin are weak in this aspect, if one wants to protect the privacy of their transactions, the apparent solutions seem to reside in Dash and Monero.

HODL is for those of us who held on to Bitcoin when it went from $1500 to $200. not when Icon went from 12 cents to 6000% in 4 weeks,dtipl99,2,1/31/2018 8:35,,,,,,

My only issue with this approach is that it's focused on the 'global money' angle as the main problem bitcoin is solving. But...

A. we already have global value units (Gold)

B. the real goal of bitcoin was how to we transact value over communication line directly (how do we do digital gold)

So yes perhaps I could say something like

1. remind people why GOLD is an important element of freedom (since we have the choice to hold our value in government or non government form).

2. remind people that in the digital world, we have NO CHOICE. (no digital equivalent of gold)

The difference between real finance and crypto finance is that while the former deals plenty with speculative assets and respective bubbles, banks ALSO finance productive investments. Investments that will hopefully generate a return over time in the form of interest or dividends.

Bitcoiners often invoke the argument that it's a fixed supply that gives Bitcoin its store of value. But in a capitalist system the exact opposite is true. New money needs to be constantly created and destroyed to make investments and grow the economy.

In my opinion none of the existing videos lay out the information in a way that my mom can actually follow and care about.

&gt;Oddly enough, it's not the technical parts (monetary theory, decentralization, hashing...) which are proving hard to write, but the OPENING 30 SECONDS. My friend put it to me this way:


&gt;I should be able to pitch the ""why"" of Bitcoin to someone in the grocery store in 30 seconds. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;And so that's where I'm still stuck. I'd love to know what your most successful 30 second ""hook"" sounds like.

1. the utility of bitcoin's decentralized uncensored network is baldly NOT represented in the value (price?) of each coin. If it were, then coins that add additional features such as Monero, and imitators such as Litecoin, would be worth more than bitcoin.

2. As more people have bought into bitcoin and the price (value?) has skyrocketed, the utility of the service decreased to the point that it was virtually unusable due to network congestion and absurd fees. Still, it was worth? more than its competitors' fully functional networks with near-instant transactions and low fees?

SnatchSnacker,"&gt; how are they making money on this? 

They make money by trading Tether at a profit. When the price of Tether is $1.01, they print some more and sell it for $1.01. When the price is $.99, they buy it back for $.99. Since they only promise it's worth $1.00, they made a penny when both buying and selling. 

Also, Bitfinex probably charges 0.1% on each trade. Having Tether available makes people want to trade more. It is the third most traded coin, after all. 

The conspiracy theory is that they are printing Tether out of thin air and using it to push the price of Bitcoin up. Then they sell the Bitcoin for cash. 

&gt; Are they holding fiat, crypto or a combination? 

No one knows for sure, but probably a combination. 

&gt; Can't all of this new found gains be tracked via banks or the blockchain? 

No one knows for sure who Tether banks with. Banks are private anyway, so only the government of the countries those banks are in could find out. 

The blockchains are visible to anyone, and we can see when new Tethers are created and when they are transferred to Bitfinex. Beyond that, no one knows where Bitfinex keeps their Bitcoin. 

&gt; Aren't they all but guaranteed they'll get caught?

If they are lying about Tether being backed by cash, eventually they will run out of money and the price of Tether will drop to $0. Then everyone will know they were lying. 

If they are telling the truth, they still might be in trouble. The US government does not like people competing with its power to create US dollars. If they can take Tether down, they will. Tether's accounts will be frozen, and the whole market will suffer. 

&gt; How long before the CFTC actually steps in? Its been longer than 30 days since the notice was sent. Whats the standard or average time frame on something like this. Shouldn't BFX/Tether have had to respond by now?

I'm not sure how much power the CFTC has over Tether, since they're not based in the US. Their US based bank closed their account, and they announced the US citizens are not allowed to use Tether. So they may not have to respond.

&gt; Even if BFX/Tether has matching deposits for every single Tether issued the Federal government has to have an issue with the idea of a ""pegged"" asset like this right? I mean is kinda obvious the main goal of Tether is to skirt Federal law isnt it? Is it possible this is just the first shot and more actions will be taken by other agencies?

Yes, you get the idea. If the FBI gets involved, they could get other countries to cooperate to shut Tether down. 

&gt; What are you doing? Hodling or cashing out?

I cashed out my initial investment, and holding the rest for now. This is a big game of musical chairs, and the music could stop tomorrow, or it could stop two years from now. It's scary, but I decided for me it's worth it.

The best possible scenario is that another solution comes along that can replace Tether without as much risk. There are some projects in the works that are trying to do this.",dtip12j,2,1/31/2018 8:24,,,,,,

kingofthejaffacakes,"The valuation of a stock isn't equal to the current balance sheet of the company divided by the number of shares.  It's equal to what the market, via supply and demand, determines it's worth.  After the IPO, the company net value and the share price bear only passing connection.

Bitcoins represent a fraction of the current market cap of Bitcoin -- as determined through market price-finding -- what's the difference?  Bitcoin's value comes from utility rather than representing a portion of a company, but that utility is as real -- no different from the value of pretty much anything else one might buy.  You don't necessarily hold Bitcoins expecting to sell them for a higher price; you hold them expecting to be able to transfer/store value.  Now -- you might reasonably think that there are going to be more people who see the utility and therefore they will have to increase in value to accomodate those users -- but so be it, expecting to profit (either via dividend or capital gain) is the reason many hold company shares too.

lte13,"The coin tether is pegged at 1:1. That is ensured by the company backing tether. 

Exchanges that dont want to bother with the regulations needed to offer real USD (like Coinbase) just use Tether instead. It serves a purpose if everyone can be sure that the company that is backing Tether can provide the amount of dollars printed.

About half a year ago or more the total Tether supply was way below of what it is today, there was maybe 10 million printed each month, and in 2016 even less than that. Since then, and along with run up in price of Bitcoin these last months, hundreds of million has been printed. The last ""batch"" of 100's was done the 23th.

Maybe 1-2 months ago people were sounding the alarm that Tether hasn't been audited and the company in charge of auditing it has removed the company from their page (Friedman LLP). So at the moment there is no way of knowing exactly how much USD they hold.

So, the worst case scenario is that Tether will be forced to admit that they don't have any USD reserves and that they are not solvent. The ones in charge of Tether will be taken to to court, Tether as a company will dissolve and the USDT tokens will be worthless.

Ari_Rahikkala,"I don't have time for a substantial response, but let me quickly snipe off a few details that seem like technical misunderstandings to me:

&gt; But the key difference in the blockchain system is that a third party ‚Äúobserves‚Ä?the transaction as it occurs and makes a third record of the exchange. This third record is then connected to the already existing record of all transactions visible to the public. As such, there is no ‚Äúfudging the numbers‚Ä?or ‚Äúcooking the books‚Ä?in triple-entry accounting. The third party, and its role as observer of the transaction, ensures that there is no conflicting report of one‚Äôs assets.

I think it's pretty confusing to call this system ""triple-entry accounting"".

For one thing, [someone already tried to use that word for their favorite accounting discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_accounting_and_triple-entry_bookkeeping), and although their choice doesn't seem to have gone anywhere much, it's still impolite and unnecessarily confusing to step on their toes.

For another thing, you could just say it's a public ledger, which is indeed the default term used in cryptocurrency discussions.

For a third thing, the part that I quoted can be done by any third party, for instance a bank; so if you think that you genuinely need a new term for the way that accounting in Bitcoin involves such a third party, you'll probably want to choose a term that makes it clearer that trustless decentralization is somehow involved.

&gt; According to miner Elaine Ou in a recent Bloomberg article, the Bitcoin network can only handle about seven transactions per second, which is several magnitudes lower than necessary to handle banking at a really significant level. To allow for the kind of exchanges currently taking place in ‚Äúnormal‚Ä?markets, extensive mining facilities will have to be established and fed with a healthy and cost-efficient energy grid. 

As I understand it, the amount of mining needed to secure transactions is a function of transacted value, not transaction count. The roughly-seven-transaction-per-second limit is simply technical (well, to a degree - the fact that it hasn't gone higher yet may indicate that there's more involved in raising the limit than just solving technical problems).

&gt; Some have argued that getting a large-scale renewable energy grid is necessary to growing the blockchain itself, and so investing in Bitcoin is also indirectly betting on the rapid increase of renewables in the energy sector.

Would be nice to learn more about these ""some"" who have argued this. As far as I know, burning coal fuels bitcoin mining just as well as solar panels. Also, you still need to actually get some value from your energy use - merely increasing energy spending for its own sake is as useful as breaking windows to support the glassmaking industry.",dtioozw,2,1/31/2018 8:17,,,,,,

1. Tether is committing fraud, as this directly contradicts all of their claims about USDT.

2. USDT still wouldn't be fully backed until they convert all of those ill-gotten bitcoins into USD. Holding reserve assets *other* than the currency you're trying to peg to means that you're vulnerable to a fluctuation in the price of bitcoin wiping your reserve out.

Volume is actually very low now and short term market is in very indecisive state, it can go up a bit in next few days but I can guarantee you it will go way down mid-term.  
When the parabolic trendline is broken we tend to see serious downtrend with price decreasing up to 80 percent from last high. That is what is happening with BTC and that is what is happening in XRP.

I think the answer to 1 is all of us. We're here (presumably) because we believe in this technology, and in Bitcoin specifically, so it's up to us to educate our peers.

Just the same, I think people will figure it out as the price continues to go up through the years.

I truly don't think 2 matters. People have been buying fractions of stocks long before Bitcoin came to be. If I want to exchange $1 for Bitcoin I can do it.

jcrew77,"1) This argument happens a lot.  Anyone that wants to run a node, can.  If they cannot afford to run a node, that is not Bitcoin's problem. If they have the value, that would indicate running a node to reduce risk, then the cost of a node would be no issue for them.  Bitcoin should not concern itself with how little it can cost to run a node.  Neither should it make nodes ridiculously expensive to run.  If they do, that will impact miners and that will impact the value of the chain. It is a balancing act, but enthusiasts nodes are not part of the equation.

2) Coffee is an example.  Really, that coffee is a week's or month's salary of some family in the unbanked economy.  The goal of myself and many like me, has always been meant to bring Bitcoin to them.  Not LN, not an altcoin, Bitcoin.  So no, it is not blockchain bloat and yes, we need to get the fees down to where they can afford to transact, on chain.  I do not see LN useful for much outside of microtransactions.  One could argue that the third world is microtransactions, but I disagree.  


Now, typically this conversation goes, ""Well if you want poor people to use Bitcoin, how do you expect them to do so when they cannot run their own node?""  I find this argument absurd.  Bitcoin was never intended for everyone to run their own node.  It was intended to have light wallets, that most people would use.  We cannot expect everyone to use Bitcoin and expect everyone to run a node.  That does not exclude anyone from running a node, that can afford to, but not being able to afford to, is not Bitcoin's problem.  It is sort of the bar to ensure that the nodes being run are quality, available and consistent.",dtioi66,2,1/31/2018 8:13,,,,,,

exab,"&gt;This is somewhat true. The legacy chain can be reorged simply by the UASF chain gaining more accumulated work. The UASF chain can only be reorged by a deliberate attack with the legacy chain splitting off some of there hash rate to mine the SF (but in doing so they make their legacy chain even more vulnerable to a reorg/wipeout)

Agreed.

&gt;Yes, or simply activate segwit before the flag date as they did with BIP 91

Agreed.

&gt;No

&gt;yes, the UASF needs more accumulated work not merely 51%

51% miner support to achieve the most accurate work.

&gt;It has nothing to do with 51% .... Do you know that ""51% attacks"" can occur with less than 51% hashpower?

51% is a shorthand. It doesn't have to be 51%. Yes, I'm aware the fact. Similar to ""the longest chain"", I said it because it's easier and commonly used/understood.

&gt;Do you understand that chain splits occur all the time; almost once a day in bitcoin? 

I'm aware stale/orphan blocks occur occasionally. Not sure how often it happens. I'm aware of chain splits caused by SPV mining, after reminded by you. Not sure how often they happen, either. Nonetheless, these chain splits happen when there is 100% miner support. It's irrelevant to my question. And doesn't it mean that even 100% miner support can't guarantee chain splits?

&gt;The Consensus code bans hostile nodes at various intervals first starting with a short term ban than a longer ban which is repeated  , with the ability to allow node operators to permanently ban nodes 

Good to know.

&gt;Its the UASF chain that bans the legacy chain , not the other way around. The legacy chain never bans the UASF nodes... they just temporarily look at them as producing a chain that doesn't have as much work so orphan off their blocks until this temporarily  **no banning occurs towards the UASF nodes and banning is simply one way** ... exactly like we see almost on a daily basis when chain splits happen. 

Good to know.

With all these being said, I still don't understand why you said it has to be 100% miner support to prevent a chain split in a soft-fork. To me, it still seems that any percentage of miner support that's enough to generate the most-worked chain will suffice.",dtioaio,2,1/31/2018 8:09,,,,,,
edouardh,"No I don't. And incidentally I don't down-vote others when I just disagree with them.

Confirmations exist to prove that the transaction has been ""recorded"" by the blockchain, since it's merely a shared ledger. They are just equal to the number of blocks since the transaction has been attached to a mined block + 1 (this block itself). After a certain number of confirmations, the transaction is considered irreversible. These confirmations are useful in case there is a divergence in the blockchain with somebody trying, for example, to double spend the same amount.

These confirmations ""checking"" is then in fact managed by the client on which you manage your address(es). If you try to transfer your ECAs to Coinhouse for example, you **won't have to wait for 5 minutes to sell them, even if the blockchain has not yet confirmed** (that is, recorded) the transaction.

Indeed, if the network propagation is fast enough to ensure an almost 0 risk of orphan block, which ‚Ä?from what I see ‚Ä?is the case for Electra one, the clients don't really have to wait for confirmations to accept the transactions, because an off-chain one would be a pure unlikely theoretical case.

I forgot the other reason: these confirmations are also important when the transactions pool is heavier than what the blocks can carry, ending in a constantly overweight pool with ""forever"" stuck transactions. And from what I understand, oppositely to Bitcoin, Electra won't hesitate to increase the block size or make it variable if necessary. So that's not an issue either.",dtioacq,2,1/31/2018 8:09,,,,,,

bitusher,"There are multiple problems bitcoin has to overcome to become a viable currency. Bitcoin is the most accepted cryptocurrency for both the white market and black market at this time because it is best suited in most the categories below compared to alts . 

1) **Liquidity** = this is the most important aspect and influences item 2. The ability to easily buy and sell bitcoin , exit large amounts of bitcoin without effecting the price, convenience of transacting is critical to becoming a viable currency. Bitcoin has the best liquidity by far with crypto but is pathetic compared to USD or EURO. 

2) **Stability**  = While bitcoin is the least volatile cryptocurrency it is far more volatile than many forms of fiat. It is difficult for merchants/users to use bitcoin if its unit of account is fluctuating so dramatically.  This will go down with a higher market cap or more liquidity in due time. 

3) **Merchant acceptance** =  Bitcoin has the most merchant acceptance by far but far below fiat. This will grow as bitcoin grows in liquidity and more users use bitcoin

4) **Quick secure confirmations** = Most merchants have had to accept btc indirectly with merchant processors due to bitcoin having 10 minute average block times (in reality its much worse than this because a conf. can occur at 1 second or take hours due to the Poisson process regardless the size of blocks) . 0 confirmation txs are insecure and most merchant processors have been eating fraud and bitcoin was mainly dependent upon altruism of their users not attacking merchants as its trivial to double spend a 0 conf tx (with or without RBF) . No altcoin(regardless their blocktime) solves this issue as merchants need instant confirmations and cannot wait. This problem is mitigated with LN transactions which are now hitting mainet with provide secure instant and secure confirmations without third parties. 

5) **Transaction capacity/ transaction fees** - Bitcoin has a pathetic capacity of ~14 Transactions per second world wide on mainet which can lead to periods of very high fees during congestion.  What makes this worse for all cryptocurrencies in general is that tx fees are prices in the cryptocurrency on mainet thus the higher value the currency becomes the higher tx fees are as a result. this means that a popular bitcoin will naturally have high txs fees if its very valuable and the only way around this to scale securely is to create a layer 2 to allow bitcoin to scale with much lower fees. Visa has an average TPS of 2k but peaks at 56k TPS . Lightning network brings bitcoins TPS to millions of transaction per second and fees down to a satoshi per tx (sometimes negative fees) to solve this issue 

6) **Usability** = More users need to become comfortable using bitcoin. This involves further adoption and better UX in wallets with better security which will come with time. ",dtio5ca,2,1/31/2018 8:06,,,,,,

BitcoinAllBot,"Here is the post for archival purposes:  

**Author**:  _apirone_com_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt; [Apirone.com](https://apirone.com/)  is a processing of bitcoin payments with the SegWit technology support.

&gt;In the project called Apirone there was created a service that is fully compatible with Blockchain.info API v1, which is so popular with a wide audience.

&gt;Apirone does not withhold customers√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ funds, does not store them, and does not manage someone else√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √Ç¬´coins√Ç¬ª. After the first confirmation of the network, they are immediately forwarded to the user's address.

&gt;Apirone was the first to make a payment forwarding with the application of the SegWit technology! As the destination address, you can indicate any type of bitcoin addresses that exists at the moment: standard addresses starting with ""1"" (P2PKH); Pay to Script Hash addresses with the SegWit support (P2SH-P2WPKH), starting with ""3""; as well as new SegWit addresses starting with ""bc"" (P2WPKH).

&gt;Transactions with a SegWit-signature are added to the blocks with a priority, and the network commission is much lower in this case, which, as a result, helps the sender of a transaction to save time and money on sending the payment.

&gt;By default, the service generates a P2SH-P2WPKH address with the SegWit support for the payments. Both old and modern bitcoin wallets can use such addresses. The service uses exactly this type of address because at the moment only about 20% of net members support the SegWit, and there is an extremely small number of wallets that support the QR-code recognition and effect payments on the native SegWit addresses.

&gt;As a matter of convenience, Apirone uses a GET-request to confirm a payment. In this case, there are no conflicts with the security policies of different stores or other access problems (for example, restrictions on POST-requests from external resources).

&gt;And for the security and anonymity geeks the company made the callback to the TOR network possible.

&gt;The API of the forwarding service is open to all the users and doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t require registration. You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to verify your email address, and the company doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have the ability to block accounts because they are simply unnecessary.

AusIV,"&gt; Why wouldn't it?

Quantum computers. Shor's algorithm will make it possible for people with quantum computers to derived private keys given a public key. This would allow then to steal funds from any address that has previously sent funds. Eventually they might even be able to front run transactions, brute forcing signatures as soon as transactions are submitted to the mempool and submitting a different one with a different recipient. At that point the blockchain will be pretty much unusable.

There are quantum safe signing algorithms, but they all have major drawbacks. They either have huge keys, keys you can only use once, or are orders of magnitude more computationally intensive than current options. All of those are detrimental to use in blockchains. Plus you'd have to get bitcoin to adopt one or more of them, and given how the segwit adoption process went I wouldn't hold my breath for it to happen in a timely fashion when quantum computers become an imminent threat.

zuaaef,"In terms of how IOTA solves miner fees: since people are doing their own PoW, the transfering of coins/info to other nodes does not give you added fees. Therefore $1.00 send from person A, will be $1.00 sent to person B regardless of how many transactions have occurred. This is especially needed in future when many devices will be talking to each other. Fees (even the smallest) will add up. Also, with IOTA, the Transactions per second increases the bigger the network gets. This is unlike old block chain with bitcoin where it get slower the more congested the network gets. I wont get into a discussion about Bitcoin being 20cents. It will well known that the fees are outrageous. I can tell you from experience that i sometimes have to pay over 10-20 dollars in fees just to get my coins transferred in some hours. This is not a viable path forawrd. If you had a pleasent experience, then good for you, but many do not have this experience. If you need a more logical explanation then check their whitepapers.

keymone,"&gt; even if that lead to less (?) nodes

it doesn't, it leads to sustainable network connectivity. eth nodes can't be compared to btc nodes because they don't do the same work.

&gt; Does node decentralisation come from the number of nodes available or the ability to run a low cost of running a node

both, obviously.

&gt; I am talking about LN channel and why there is a fundamental difference between LN channel and with BTC nodes.

you were talking that LN nodes ""need routing"", but when i pointed out that they don't and just broadcast their presence you started talking how it's bad that LN nodes broadcast data even though you obviously know that bitcoin nodes *also* do a lot of broadcasting.

&gt; users hate always online system

then you have nothing to worry about. LN will die in flames and will be forgotten. why are people on this sub so obsessed with details of LN implementation?

&gt; That will limit LN usage, this is not FUD. It is fact

well i have no problem with statement like that, but that's a sharply different tone to your suggestions that LN won't work at all because of that limitation. *that's* a FUD and it's widespread on this sub.

&gt; LN wallet on your phone can receive payment for example, because a phone can be always internet on.

somebody is still living in 90s? my phone has internet connection 24/7.

&gt; why it best to force low requirements for nodes if it reduces decentralisation

you haven't addressed my actual comment at all. point was how forcing low cost participants creates a feedback loop that converges on all participants being big corporations with extremely expensive hardware. try again.

&gt; The philosophy of cheap nodes don‚Äôt make sense to me

it's not about cheap, it's about not allowing the cost to reach escape velocity, where all nodes are controlled by big corps.

&gt; is there enough demand for BTC tx to fill a block wth +$80 tx fees?

first, you seem to misunderstand how fees work. if i'm unwilling to pay $80 then i have the option to pay $40 and wait longer or just wait and pay less later, because dropping demand will drop transaction fees.

second, you have simplistic view of sustainability. it's not just about whether people will want to continue to pay the price for being on chain, it's also about whether miners will want to mine the chain. when halfening happens BTC is suffering less because miners' losses are offset by fees. that's *better* sustainability.

&gt; From that link

lie number one.

Adam's tweet was in response to a guy saying that people would pay $20 for secure ledger like bitcoin. Adam's response was that *he would pay $100*, though it would be nice if fees were smaller.

there is literally no way to misconstrue that tweet so that it means ""i'm looking forward to $100 fees"".

lie number two.

from that greg's email:

&gt; I'd also personally prefer to pay lower fees-- current levels even
challenge my old comparison with wire transfer costs-- but we should
look most strongly at difficult to forge market signals rather than
just claims--

so again, not a hint of ""looking forward to pay $1000"".

Because of that, it's VERY rare for someone to get addicted to something and he able to go back into it more lighthearredly/not letting it control their lives so much.we are talking a needle in a fucking hay stack- and practically everyone thinks they can be this one in a million capable of it AND EVERY SINGLE addict WANTS to be.

frisian2,"Ik begrijp volledig waar dit weg komt, en een verbod op cryptocurrency (of althans hele strikte regels waaraan voldaan moet worden alvorens ze als legaal worden gezien in Nederland) zal mij persoonlijk niet verbazen. 

Het grote probleem met cryptocurrency is dat je het eigenlijk geen legitiem betaalmiddel zou mogen noemen op basis van hoe het momenteel gebruikt wordt.

Laat me dit even uitleggen. Zelfs als je verzot op cryptocurrency bent dan zie je dat het (vrijwel) niet als betaalmiddel voor legitieme doeleinden wordt gebruikt. Oplichters en criminelen gebruiken cryptocurrency daar wel voor maar dit is om uit handen te blijven van de opsporingsdiensten. Daarbij kiezen ze voor de beste platformen die de meeste privacy bieden en die zich op dit moment al niet aan de bestaande wetgeving houden omtrent financi√´le transacties in zowel de EU als de VS. 

Ik weet het, het zijn niet alleen criminelen die cryptocurrency bezitten het zijn ook gewone mensen. En ja je hebt gelijk er zijn genoeg niet criminelen die in cryptocurrency hebben ge√Ønvesteerd, ik moet eerlijk bekennen dat ik er ook een tijdje over heb nagedacht maar vanwege het grote probleem achter cryptocurrency heb ik besloten dit niet te doen.

Het grote probleem van cryptocurrency is, is dat in mijn optiek cryptocurrency compleet waardeloos is als legitieme munt. Waarom? Nou dat is simpel, de enige waarde achter cryptocurrency is het feit dat het de anonimiteit bied voor criminele doeleinden, zodra een cryptocurrency zoals bitcoin en de daarbij behorende trading platformen zich aan de wet gaan houden dan zit er geen enkele waarde meer aan het product. Het is dus gewoon een piramidespelletje waar mensen die vroeg in zijn gestapt winst kunnen maken, maar op een gegeven moment zullen investeerders het een te riskante investering vinden en dan knapt de bubbel.

Ja cryptocurrency moet in mijn optiek dan ook niet als een betaalmiddel worden gezien, maar als een extreem riskant investeringsproduct waar geen enkel product aan ten grondslag licht. (zelfs renteswaps hebben in mijn optiek een beter product dan cryptocurrency en we hebben allemaal gezien hoe goed dat is gegaan).

Chaike,"I think that, regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, this whole series of events (starting with Bitcoin's rise last fall/winter) has set the stage for the next generation - the stable generation - of Cryptocurrencies.

Before Bitcoin mooned, crypto was mostly seen by the public as a scam and a waste of money. But now that all of these altcoin projects have been funded by the market influx, and people/companies have seen the use of crypto, it's inevitable that a crash will wipe out the weakest projects and leave the ones that have the strongest support and most utility to consumers. 

The market is far too saturated at the moment, and there's no way this number of coins can sustain itself; people will have to spread themselves far too thin to keep everything afloat, so they'll most likely abandon their lesser choices in a crisis, and either dump their money in a more stable coin, or withdraw altogether.

Because of this, I don't think Bitcoin will disappear - digital gold will still have worth, and it's far too popular to disappear overnight - however I do think that this Tether issue (and the subsequent equivalent of a bank run; a coin run, I guess) will bring in a unanimous decision to focus on more stable coins for everyday currency; just like how we switched from the gold standard to fiat.

Just like normal gold, Bitcoin is far too volatile for anything beyond long-term investment, and obviously more susceptible to manipulation. Well-funded/developed coins like XLM, XRP, ADA, etc. will be much more capable of adopting the crypto-equivalent title of fiat, as that's what they were designed to do initially, more or less.",dtinat7,2,1/31/2018 7:47,,,,,,

obit33,"&gt; What part of the government do you expect honesty from - even under a microscope?

none really indeed... so you should check zcash's sponsors... DARPA is in there...

&gt; If everyone was happy with XMR privacy, why are the clones upping the mixins further?

Can you point me to any scientific proof that says 'higher mixins = better privacy'. If so I'd like to see it. No idea why the clones are upping it, I think they're just moneygrabs who add nothing to the space atm... They change a few parameters and say 'we're better now', without any proof...

&gt; After zk-stark review I'd expect that to be implemented.

Allright, that would be great... but as long as privacy is not mandatory in zcash, the privacy will be lacking...

&gt; Ultimately, I'm interested in building a highly resilient, uncensorable, fungible, private, exchange for goods and services.

Same here, so we should look at technology and implementation for what it is... and, for example, not be calling ring signatures a 'bitcoin mixer'...

I'll admit, I'm quiet happy with my current set up for using and storing BTC so i cant see myself using this anytime soon.

However at the same time, most people who are very skeptical about Bitcoin and cryptos in general allways make the same argument at some point of the conversation being ""banks will never get behind this"" and is normally the final point that puts them off ever investing. 

Something like this I believe should make bitcoin more appealing to the masses.",dtimulf,2,1/31/2018 7:37,,,,,,

iago_bot,"I am far from an expert in economy but here is opinion.

I think no-one in Cryptocurrencies believes that there will be no banks.

I personally think it is reasonable to assume there will be banks for loans, but not central banks (which asset would they control if it does neither require nor allow their control) or banks based on the fractional reserve system (since an inflation of the currency by creation of money is not possible in BCH or BTC). They could theoretically (and definitely will) derive any kind of asset (similar to tether) out of thin air on top of Crypto which can be inflated and controlled, but this requires that somebody uses or accepts it as some kind of commodity.  

The difference in the world would be that not all assets are depts (as it currently is) and that loans can not be paid back purely by having negative real interest rates (as currently the case in both Europe and the US). Currently on both continents, the central bank tries to solve their dept crisis by making insolvent countries (like e.g. Italy or Greece) solvent again by devaluing the money in which they have to pay loans, this would be impossible if crypto became the future of money. 

Instead: **a loan has to be paid back by an increase of productivity**. Say you lend me 10 BCH for my startup and demand 11 back, then I can only rely on an increase of productivity, thus earning the interest rate. 

Now comes the catch, where I don't know the answer: **Is it actually reasonable to have a non-dept based currency system which does not allow an exponential growth of capital?** I would say, yes we should try it. Possibly the frontiers of economy disagree and see the modern fractional reserve system as necessary. 

Edit1: I forgot about the most important point of my answer: Surely there will banks, but it will not be forced onto you to store your capital at a bank (as it currently is). You basically become your own bank (with all pros and cons that come with it). 

Edit2: I think your questions is very important and to few people have given it a deep thought. It might be the case that the fractional reserve system (even though people are gonna roast me for saying this), actually increases the growth of an economy (with the mandatory crashes) more than a non-inflation based monetary system (as Bitcoin) ever could.

**Author**:  _CryptidCollective_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;For me there are two things that Bitcoin needs to do:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&gt;If it wants to be a store of value, a true store of value to rival gold, it needs to have a group of people or organisation that can act on it's behalf to lobby institutions, countries and banks to embrace it in this way, and buy in. There needs to be a concentrated effort to achieve this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&gt;If it want's to be viewed as a currency by all, it needs to be represented not as entire singular Bitcoins, but as Bits instead. The way the price is represented now is psycologically prohibitive to most people, if it appeared 'cheaper' it would appear more accessible to many more people. Exchanges need to start representing it like this.
And a small side effect may be that the price becomes less volatile, if smaller fractions are dealt with, the bigger the price or unit, adjustments to it become magnified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

bitusher,"&gt; the legacy chain can be reorged;

This is somewhat true. The legacy chain can be reorged simply by the UASF chain gaining more accumulated work. The UASF chain can only be reorged by a deliberate attack with the legacy chain splitting off some of there hash rate to mine the SF (but in doing so they make their legacy chain even more vulnerable to a reorg/wipeout)

&gt; the legacy chain has to hard-fork to prevent a reorg/wipeout possibility.

Yes, or simply activate segwit before the flag date as they did with BIP 91

&gt;It seems to me that UASF chain can reorg/wipe out the legacy chain as long as it has 51% miner suppor

No

&gt;(to achieve the most accumulated work ultimately). 

yes, the UASF needs more accumulated work not merely 51%

&gt;This is why I believed soft-forks need 51% miner support to avoid a chain split. 

It has nothing to do with 51% .... Do you know that ""51% attacks"" can occur with less than 51% hashpower?

&gt;But you said it's 100%.

Do you understand that chain splits occur all the time; almost once a day in bitcoin? 

&gt;You also said the banning effect lasts.

The Consensus code bans hostile nodes at various intervals first starting with a short term ban than a longer ban which is repeated  , with the ability to allow node operators to permanently ban nodes 

&gt; It can't be true if the legacy chain can be reorged by UASF chain.

Its the UASF chain that bans the legacy chain , not the other way around. The legacy chain never bans the UASF nodes... they just temporarily look at them as producing a chain that doesn't have as much work so orphan off their blocks until this temporarily  **no banning occurs towards the UASF nodes and banning is simply one way** ... exactly like we see almost on a daily basis when chain splits happen.

devMartel,"The hope is a ""cooler heads will prevail"" thought process. Obviously if everyone is dedicated to a sell off, the sell off will continue day by day with a stop to trading if the drop is too precipitous each day, but it can prevent a full blown sell-off panic, which is what happened in 1929.

Obviously with BTC it's a little different because there isn't a productive company behind it, just speculation. This makes it even more susceptible to a sell-off. Halting trades keeps the price stable so it sends a signal to people not actively trading that the price isn't plummeting and that they shouldn't get out now.

I think there are a few very wealthy people involved with Bitcoin that want to keep the price buoyed either ideologically or because they're preparing their own pump and dump and are playing a bit of a prisoner's dilemma game against other very wealthy people wanting to do the same thing.",dtimlay,2,1/31/2018 7:31,,,,,,

bwwatr,"Take that RRSP matching as soon as humanly possible.  Until you do, you're leaving free money behind.

For saving up a downpayment, you don't want to take any stock market risk, since you will need the money (1) in a small number of years, and (2) all at once.  Taking market risk is appropriate when saving for more distant goals, and/or when money is withdrawn gradually (eg. retirement).  A savings account is far more appropriate for the downpayment goal.

You can save for retirement at the same time as saving for a home though.  Only you can decide how to allocate your monthly contributions.  You could do something like:

1) Retirement savings through work 5%+5%

2) Robo-advisor (eg. WealthSimple) retirement savings (some percentage that you pick) - RRSP or TFSA, or both (with a 60k income, you may wish to start with the RRSP, but not use it so much that it puts taxable income into the tax bracket below where you are now)

3) Home downpayment savings in a [high-interest savings account](http://highinterestsavings.ca/chart) within a TFSA if you have the contribution room to spare, and taxable if not

Then let payroll deduction take care of #1, and then automate your contributions to #2 and 3.

You could say buying Bitcoin is investing, in the strictest sense, but, it is very volatile, speculative, and not diversified.  I wouldn't advise putting *more* money into crypto, but if you're happy riding the wave with a small commitment, I wouldn't advise taking anything out either.

MartinGandhiKennedy,"**CoinGeek.com announces funding of up to USD $300,000 per year for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) open source projects to be developed by the Electron Cash team.**

***

&gt; The Electron Cash team will manage all development.

***

*Enhancing CoinGeek.com‚Äôs financial investment, nChain will provide technical advice, support from its research and development team members, and intellectual property licenses when relevant for selected projects. nChain‚Äôs Chief Scientist Craig Wright will work with the Electron Cash team to advise on projects.*

***

&gt; ‚ÄúAnybody with a knowledge of BCH understands that it is the all-in-one cryptocurrency for the future.  But BCH is in its early stages, and needs more technical advancements to make it easily used in daily life ‚Ä?especially at the enterprise level.  That‚Äôs why we support open source projects that make sure the best ideas in cryptocurrency are built into the BCH ecosystem.‚Ä?**- Calvin Ayre**

***

&gt; ‚ÄúTo have this level of financial muscle from CoinGeek.com and technical expertise from nChain means we have the resources to develop numerous software projects that will help the BCH community.  We are excited to contribute our part to help achieve the original Satoshi Nakamoto white paper‚Äôs vision that got us all so excited in the first place.‚Ä?**- Jonald Fyookball**

***

&gt; ‚ÄúThis three-party initiative with Electron Cash, CoinGeek.com and nChain exemplifies the teamwork that is needed, with groups around the world, for Bitcoin Cash to succeed.  We‚Äôre especially excited to work with the Electron Cash team to help realize implementations of some of our patent-pending inventions ‚Ä?such as blinded threshold signatures.‚Ä?**- Jimmy Nguyen**

***

&gt; ‚ÄúCreating better BCH applications is important but just the beginning.  We are also launching campaigns to educate merchants about the benefits of adopting Bitcoin Cash as a lower fee, fast payment system.  These educational efforts will really hit a peak at our CoinGeek Conference in Hong Kong this May.‚Ä?**- Calvin Ayre**

You cannot mine *Bitcoin* with a PC anymore: you need specific hardware to do that that is made specifically for mining crypto. You can mine other altcoins with a GPU though.  I won't get into whether or not that's even a good idea because it will only evoke animosity around here to take a stand one way or another.

 I just highly recommend that you do research before getting into crypto mining in particular, and to make sure your research isn't coming exclusively from those who have the same opinions. Like everything else these days, making decisions in an echo chamber isn't very wise. 

I mentioned in my other comment you should check the sidebar and PCPartPicker. Maybe watch a few YouTube videos. If you aren't sure what RAM and a GPU are you have a lot to learn and you need the basics. That doesn't translate in a Reddit comment. There's plenty of info to be found.  Start with those places.

obit33,"Since you're the one talking about conflating issues:

&gt; Monero is a Bitcoin mixer with an infinite coin supply. With default mixes in monero you're not much better off than a Bitcoin mixer and currently not much safer.

No it's not, monero uses ring signatures to hide sender: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHN_B_H_fCs It also uses stealth addresses (hide receiver) and ring-ct (hide amounts). These three things combined make monero one of the strongest privacy-coins out there, and way way better than a bitcoin mixer, case in point: https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FSietBhv.png&amp;t=585&amp;c=K0DvRCg6SxfaVg and also why xmr is the preffered currency on the dnms...

About the infinite coin supply: monero has a tail emission indeed, about 0.6% per annum... would you say that gold (2% inflation per annum) is a highly inflationary asset? Don't think so...

Zk-snarks are a great cryptographic technique, but the way zcash implemented optional privacy (and not mandatory as in monero) is very very problematic as show in this research from Quesnelle: https://z.cash/blog/new-research-on-shielded-ecosystem.html
quote: 'Using this heuristic our analysis matched 31.5% of all coins sent to shielded addresses.'

Further more Zcash has an insane 'founders reward' and needed a trusted setup, trust is antithetical to good crypto if I recall correctly :-)

anyway, another nice read (if you are open to it, since it's on the monero stack exchange): https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/83/how-does-monero-privacy-and-security-compare-to-zcash

After the Wall Street mafia declared war on Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies in at least three cases quite recently, it was the turn of Facebook to obey by choosing the camp of Western banking cabal against Cryptocurrencies.

The decision is not coincidental. It comes right after Russia made a first move to issue its own Cryptocurrency, followed by other countries who expressed their willing to issue their own Cryptocurrencies, with latest example Belarus, in order to escape the Dollar and the Western monetary monopoly.

The fact that Facebook's board of directors includes investors whose firms have been prominent crypto backers, strongly indicates that the company was actually forced to follow the camp of the Western banking cabal in its campaign against Cryptocurrencies.

* Purchase an affordable amount every week or paycheck
* Don't look at price
* Don't sell if your outlook is 10-20 years
* Ignore the morons on this sub

I bought $100-$150 every week since late 2012. I didn't look at the price.  Every 6-12 months if my bitcoin wealth was too much, I did liquidate to balance my portfolio so that bitcoin was never more than 12% of my net worth (and preferably 6%).

Did I sell and throw away millions?  Probably, but who cares, I still acquired assets using the cash.

I still buy $100-$150 a week, every week.  I still ignore the price.  If it's up, I get less bitcoin that week.  If it's down, I get more.  I don't care.

But, **I am thankful for people like OP** because emotional buyer-sellers who buy more than they can afford actually help us patient buyers who don't invest emotionally.

ETHprospector,"I have been scouring the web sifting through volumes of mindless uninformed banter between angry individuals the past few days hoping to find a solid argument for Tether not coming to a fiery end. Something other than ""quit being FUD the money is in the bank."" So thank you for giving me a little hope that I'm not the only one out there thinking there could be a win win (or at least not a win apocalypse) solution to this problem. That said I have some questions and would like your thoughts.

First I think we both agree 100% cash on hand isn't even in the cards. If the auditor can't find a bank account with a 2.2 billion dollar balance in a month it doesn't exist. Also like you I believe just because the cash doesn't exist doesn't mean the money's not there.

Here is where I need some clarification on your analysis though. I hope I am correctly assuming that they will not be issuing a *NEW* 2 billion Tether into the market, but rather you are saying they will buy back the 2.2 billion already in existence. Again assuming this is the case then we agree Tether Limited in some way had the 2.2 billion or enough to cover all outstanding Tethers at one point in time; whether it be cash or coin we gave it to them. Where I think we might disagree is whether or not they still have that. Your scenario where they cause panic and buy them back for a profit assumes that they have at least 90% of liquid assets and cash on hand to buy these up at a discount over a relatively short period of time. Short of cash and crypto I can't think of any investment that would provide them with that kind of liquidity. I think that because the ""leadership of Tether/Bitfinex"" are firm believers in crypto they took part of that 2.2 billion an purchased (or kept) a stake in various coins; with a strong emphasis on bitcoin. Now that the price of coins marketwide has dropped im assuming they are holding a good deal of coins worth less than 70% of what they paid for them. So now the problem. How do they convert 2+ billion tokens into the amount of cash they have in their account before the auditors find them? I can see only 3 ways for this to go. 

1) They don't they say F'it were out and go to live in Antarctica with Hitler and the Yeti.
2) Some hacker group comes in and steals all the tokes or...
3) They shift all the liability back onto us without us ever being the wiser. How? Well first they would need to reduce their token supply by forcing all their crypto back onto the consumers. That bitcoin you gave them to hold that was worth 20k tokens; you are getting it back. Doesn't matter to them if you want to convert it to hard cash or keep it as a bitcoin, but once it's yours it will not be converted back. Why can't you convert it back? Because they added a new clause to their TOS that states ""Beginning on January 1, 2018, Tether Tokens will no longer be issued to U.S. Persons."" Now that the tokens are safely back in their position they can take them off the books or better yet... they can buy more bitcoins driving the price up 15% - 20% push more bitcoins back on you take the difference in tokes out of circulation. Stop buying them and wait for the market to fall and do it again. In theory they could do this until their supply was safely back under control. Slowing rolling out new regulations on why you can't buy your Tether tokens back and executing seizures of ""violating"" accounts. This is what I think will / is happening. Whether or not they can do it before we realize what is happening and stop buying them, in my mind that's the billion dollar question. But one thing is for sure they don't want an auditor telling us that plan.

Ant-n,"&gt;&amp;gt; You seem to be making assumptions, how can you know they all using fast sync?

&gt;it's not an assumption, it's a conclusion i made from plethora of comments and issues from people not being able to do a full sync. you can find it in google fairly easily.

Well then that‚Äôs an assumption a weak, a rather weak one on top of that.

&gt;&amp;gt; adding this feature could increase Bitcoin nodes up to 9x

&gt;the goal shouldn't be maximising number of nodes (at some point there is just enough to ensure reliable propagation of transactions and block headers), it should be keeping cost of running a node in check. 

So the point of BTC is to keep the cost of running a node as low as possible even if that lead to less (?) nodes.

Does node decentralisation come from the number of nodes available or the ability to run a low cost of running a node?

those two things doesn‚Äôt seem to be correlated.

&gt;atm cost of running eth node is much higher.

Yes, and as I said before it hasn‚Äôt prevented ETH to have more nodes than BTC. So what is best?

&gt;&amp;gt; The topology is dynamic, nodes need to broadcast their status (not only presence but liquidity, etc..) each time a transaction is made

&gt;you replied with that to me refuting your own words that ""Bitcoin node broadcasts they don‚Äôt have to find a route"" - are you trying to refute yourself? took mah job!

I am talking about LN channel and why there is a fundamental difference between LN channel and with BTC nodes.

There is concept of liquidity for a Bitcoin node.

&gt;&amp;gt; Certainly, time will tell if they can stay independent.

&gt;for sure time will tell, but the attitude on this sub is as if that is already a fact.

Yes, The attitude is to be skeptical, like anyone should be when it comes to extraordinary claim.

LN definitely has to prove itself and shouldn‚Äôt be taken as granted IMO.

&gt;&amp;gt; FUD suggests I lied about the limitations

&gt;no, FUD is *fear*, *uncertainty* and *doubt*. it is FUD to be claiming the ""always online"" limitation is a blocker to LN adoption, which you yourself have confirmed is ""Overblown maybe"".

Well, users hate always online system.

Feedback from your.org and open bazaar proves it.

That will limit LN usage, this is not FUD. 
It is fact.

That will likely mean no LN wallet on your phone can receive payment for example, because a phone can be always internet on.

&gt;&amp;gt; Can you elaborate, all the data I know suggests the opposite

&gt;very easy: the higher the cost to run a node, the more people on the low end will decide not to do that (do not want to invest in more hardware/bandwidth/etc). as people on low end disconnect, the average network hardware/bandwidth/etc *goes up*, which will support higher demand with lower fees, driving even more lower-cost participants out. rinse and repeat - you're stuck with nodes only running expensive hardware out of datacenters controlled by large corporations.

Ok, but why it best to force low requirements for nodes if it reduces decentralisation?

Running a ETH nodes is more expensive but also more **usefull** so it result in more nodes, more decentralisation.

The philosophy of cheap nodes don‚Äôt make sense to me, because it lead to very expensive transactions.. who are those peoples too poor to run a nodes but rich enough to afford +$10 fees.. that make no sense..

People run node because it is useful for them, not because it is cheap..

It is just wierd to constrain the whole system (to the point it hurt decentralisation) to ensure those who are the least likely to run a node can.

&gt;&amp;gt; On block rewards is gone fees will need to remain beyond $20-80 to sustainable a reasonable amount of POW.

&gt;well guess what, having a fee market *helps* during halfenings because the revenue lost from coinbase is offset by higher fees. of course least efficient miners will be pushed out, but that will be more extreme on BCH chain because nothing offsets the revenue lost.

Certainly but what matters is long term sustainability.. is there enough demand for BTC tx to fill a block wth +$80 tx fees?

I doubt so.

 **Content**:  

 &gt;Dear  [r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin) !

&gt;Just recently I started thinking about crypto and decided to invest a small amount of money with intention of holding it for a bit and spending it as bitcoin as well. I got a little bit hasty and bought at quite a high rate, and I'm currently at ~10% loss but with much hope of recovering in the long run :) I currently own ~0.01 BTC so it's not much but it's still something for my student budget. I'm also considering buying some more soon (good time to buy right?)

&gt;I initially bought the sum with Coinbase (now in hindsight I probably would look for a different way) and I'm planning to move my BTC from Coinbase to my own Electrum wallet. I plan on HODL'ing for a couple of years before spending (if financial situation allows)

&gt;My question is - should I make a **bech32 Segwit wallet or a legacy one&lt;/strong&gt;? I've been reading on segwit adoption for a couple of weeks, and those even lower transaction fees are very tempting future-wise. Can I even tranfser my BTC from Coinbase to a bech32 segwit address? Bonus question: What broker would you suggest for low quantity exchanges (I'm based in Europe)?

**Author**:  _MountainGoal_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;Really feeling like shit right now, would like to share my story with you. 

&gt;I bought my first Bitcoin in 2015, and as the price dipped from 600 to 250 USD, I kind of forgot about it. Around April 2017 as the price was climbing again, I started to pay more attention and invest more. Around June I was 90% in, all the money I had worked for at that point in my life (was 28 at the time), around 50k usd, was in crypto. In retrospect, that was somewhat of a reckless move on my part, but at the time I was just so excited about it, couldn't think of nothing else. I was averaging in and following the price and news constantly to make sure I could get out in case something bad would happen, so I didn't lose that money I put in. 

&gt;My biggest concern was not losing money. And as the price of crypto grew larger, so did my anxiety around it. With time, it changed me. I grew more and more concerned and to try and calm myself down, I kept a constant eye on twitter, blockfolio, youtube, etc... At times I would get scared and sell some of my position, and later on re-buy it at a higher price. I became more distante to the people I love, specially my gf, having all this anxiety just killed my sexual desire and its almost costing me the relationship ... I thought before all this we were soulmates, now most of the time I just feel nothing inside. 

&gt;The drop from 20k to 10k had me sell 75% of my position at the bottom... (incredible how I can time the bottom...), and now with the price recovering, that bad decision cost me 20k usd. That's 4x what I make in a month and it hurts to have done this mistake. I'm mostly in fiat now and too scared to buy back in. Every decision is so hard to make and I feel like I can lose badly in any case, so this pressure is just killing me inside. I can't think of nothing else. The only time I have relief is when sleeping but as soon as I wake up and think about all this money I lost with my stupid decisions and not being able to hodl and makes me feel incredibly bad again. 

&gt;In the end I still increased my usd value and kept some of my crypto, but I just don't seem to be able to focus on that. The amount that I lost through being scared calls more of my attention and sinks my mood. I hope this reaches anyone out there who's getting started with this. There's a gambling addiction aspect to all this and some people like me might be vulnerable. Although I have more money now, my quality of life has decreased, I'm more moody, restless, angry. Can't focus at work and feel real bad overall. And the thing is I don't know if I could've avoided all this, my family struggled with money when I was a kid so it's a big thing for me today. Crypto just hit me like a train and I feel like a train wreck right now. 

&gt;tl;dr: bad decision that lead me to this shitty psychological state I'm in right now
- investing too much
- not being able to hodl during drops.. this is not for everyone
- caring more about returns than the tech itself
- becoming dependent on looking at price
- valuing money over relationships ",dtilj01,2,1/31/2018 7:04,,,,,,

 &gt;Hi  [/r/bitcoin](/r/bitcoin) ,

&gt;I went travelling, didn't know any drug dealers and bought using the deep web whilst I was away. I had totally forgotten about it until I tried signing in to my local bitcoin accounts last night.
One has about √Ç¬£22 in, the other has about √Ç¬£30 in (not bad considering this was just small leftover change from buying weed)
Is it worth doing anything with these? Should I just leave them? 
I've been thinking about leaving one and investing in alt coins with the other.
Any thoughts?

I am starting a job in 2 week but rent is due now.  Things money is used for.

Finish repaying a loan that is open now   
Rent   
Groceries   

I lost my income unexpectantly a couple months back but will be employed again.  I don't want to leave this person on the hook for the loan longer than necessary either.

Will pay back $450 over 3 months time (March, April, May1st).  It may be paid back earlier as it's a government job and they usually pay a little early.

I have $65 in Bitcoin that I can actually send now as part of a first payment.  I'm mining another coin as well that, alone, could pay the loan back in time but with a job, will not be an issue.  

You can check my history and see all loans have been paid back and I've had good communication.

Thank you for your time.

Yes, the potential is there, if you bought low enough. Don‚Äôt worry about the market cap. It‚Äôs all digital tokens that are earned without using real fiat $, So it could be whatever number you want. But as long as there is enough demand for the tokens they will increase in value. Again this is what supply and demand is about. And I wouldn‚Äôt have invested if I didn‚Äôt think this will have enormous demand. No other crypto has the user base KIN does. Every time someone earns a token or a developer is rewarded tokens it creates demand. You don‚Äôt even need an exchange. 

And above is a link showing a man who bought $27 worth of BTC in 2009 and it‚Äôs worth 980k. 

Problem with most people is that they won‚Äôt hodl that long. 

I also highly recommend listening to the podcast with Ted Livingston. It‚Äôs very informative and it may change you‚Äôre thinking as well. 

Oh and BTW that article is old if he is still holding he has $55 mil at today‚Äôs BTC price. 

And why would KIN use an out of this world never gonna happen in a million years example of a real world use case where KIN is $1? Unless they thought It had the potential.

MinerDon,"&gt; Interest rates on cards are pretty high around 10-18%

&gt; invest the inheritance and pay debt off slowly?

In order for this to make any sense the rate of return on your investment would need to be higher than the rate of interest you are paying on your debt.  

For the money you've borrowed at 18% APR you would need to earn more than 20% per annum on your investment just to break even due to capital gains taxes.

""High yield"" savings accounts are paying just over 1% currently.  What low-risk investment is going to yield 20%+ per year?  

INB4 someone mentions the word ""bitcoin.""

The real emergency here is paying 18% on that money.

The plan:

1) pay down all debts

2) setup emergency fund

3) invest

mjpirate,"Zcash vs monero- the question arises often. The answers you got in /r/monero conflated the issue heavily with other similar coins.

The dev fees, reasonable if used to enrich the ecosystem, last I checked are all holding in a transparent wallet.

Monero is a Bitcoin mixer with an infinite coin supply. With default mixes in monero you're not much better off than a Bitcoin mixer and currently not much safer.

Scalability and fees are significantly lower in zcash. Privacy is backed up by every private transaction occurring in zcash. 

The whole field of transactions without identifiable data adds to the anonymity.

Privacy is available for desktop wallets, the key generation ceremony is expanding to be more resilient. Even you can participate.

We know they are unwilling to compromise on block size, they are just as stuck on their siege mentality, which tells me that someone, somewhere, fancies themselves in control of Bitcoin and thinks they might lose their imagined power.

How they arrived at the presumption that they ought to be controlling Bitcoin is what fascinates me. It's so antithetical to the founding ideas and the actions of Satoshi.

If Bitcoin is as anti-fragile as I believe, then this kind of thinking means they already lost what they were trying to hold.

Saffuran,"First of all don't just look for &lt;$50 coins, there is no guarantee they will all gain at the same rate, the key is the supply of the currency. There are nearly 17 million full Bitcoins and 97+ million Ethereum as of today. Stellar, Ripple, Cardano e.t.c. are hyperinflated (the former two are also centralized and bad examples of cryptocurrency // possible scams) and will never be able to reach the same valuations.

Read technicals and watch the market with an eye on assets with units circulating between 10 million and 100 million in most cases if you are looking for an asset to increase on individual dollars. If you were targeting solid cryptos in that area that could see solid increases this year, my picks would be NEO and Monero (XMR) with a possible run from Bitcoin Cash in the wings.

As for where the value of Blockchain technology comes from, that all stems from this literally being a disruptive technology that can fundamentally change many facets of business and life beyond stores of value and currencies. The idea of a decentralized no-trust-required ledger that cannot be hacked directly is a massive implementation and could be used for storage of government documents, health records, hold home and land deeds, be utilized for democracy and voting e.t.c. on top of changing how we pay for things, changes distribution of income while increasing efficiency through the implementation of smart contracts e.t.c. All without restriction of bureaucracy and borders that can truly establish what many would call a ""global economy"" in a way never seen before.

Even just focusing on simply the money aspect of cryptocurrencies, the combined world GDP is 118 Trillion, what happens as Ethereum or Bitcoin or whatever else begin to take up more and more of the global transaction market, the cap of cryptocurrencies is not in competition with other market caps but can grow alongside them, and with a modest overall market cap of just over 500 Billion the cryptocurrency market is fledgling still. Ethereum itself is valued at just over 100 million, not even a drop in the bucket for context and comparison with the big picture. Of course, all of this is still speculative, but as these technologies scale to grow and meet increasing global demand, their market caps will rise and a market valuation of trillions of dollars for the entire sector is not unreasonable. If someday all current ratios maintained and the global cryptocurrency market cap hit 10 trillion (less than 10% of global transaction share) that would be a 20x gain from current levels, and certain technologies like Ethereum are far outpacing their competition and could capture a much larger share of future gains as it establishes itself as the dominant technology in the sector.

I hold mostly Ethereum with some Bitcoin Cash (recently sold my stake in Bitcoin since I see the other two outperforming it), I hold because these technologies are fundamentally world changing if only for the efficiency they provide and the risk is relatively low even if the market is volatile at these levels because we are nowhere near where these assets could be valued in a year, five years, and ten years time.

**Author**:  _thefirm17982_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;I was on a long earned trip and I just came to korea and found out that bitcoin took a hit (or in other words, a sale) I woke up after drinking for 2 days and I found out that I made a spreadsheet of 'how to make money using bitcoins' while I was drunk
Most of the ideas were stupid but one of them caught my eye.
Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies are overpriced in Korea, so if I could get some people (investors???) from America (or wherever bitcoin is 'cheap') to send me bitcoin I could sell them and buy some coins which difference is not that big and send it to them. They would sell the coins and buy more bitcoin with it and we would repeat over and over. I would use a screen sharing program so that the investors would know everything that is going on my screen. We would split the fees and profits 50/50

But I must disagree with the rest of your statement. The Bitcoin has absolutely no credibility as a usable currency system.

The block chains block size is way too small relative to the number of transactions, causing astronomically high transaction fees. This mean you wanna pay someone 5 bucks you might need to pay 30 in transaction fees.

Double spending is a real problem. You need to wait more than half a day after the payment is registered in the blockchain (which already may take a long time) to have a good enough certainty that you really received that payment.

JoelDalais,"&gt;lighting network or similar solutions will work, 

Lightning introduces multiple points of ""central"" failure. Ask yourself, why is ""decentralization"" important? What is the folly of ""centralization"" that we have learned and that Bitcoin was built to overcome?

Yes, it was partly to eliminate the ""middle-man"", but why?

https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/

For example, in the UK I can use the traditional banking system (or god forbid, FidorUK), and send tx's to someone else in a pretty speedy manner (instant with Fidor to Fidor, **please** this is **NOT** a recommendation for FidorUK), or with standard banks 10-15 minutes (sometimes sooner), at zero fee.

Tell me why Bitcoin (not lightning) is better than the UK banking system?

Then tell me why ""lightning network"" is better than the UK banking system?

&gt;Those tx will be quicker and cheaper

Hypothetical (in the future);

Everyone is on LN, you want to join LN, but to join LN you need bitcoin.

1) To get Bitcoin you need to be on LN because all the exchanges, platforms use LN now.

2) You have to make an on-chain tx 1st, to open a LN channel, but you need Bitcoin.

3) So how do you get this initial bitcoin so you can join LN?

4) Do you buy it from an exchange? 

But how, they all use LNCoin, no one uses bitcoin anymore because everyones moved onto LN and because there are no mining rewards (on the main chain) the miners stopped bothering mining since there are rewards on other coins that make those other coins more rewarding to mine.

So even IF you could get any Bitcoin, how do you move it anywhere to even open a channel? Since miners don't exist at this point on LNCoin (everyones on LN, yay, its ""cheaper and quicker"" urm.. wait a second).

Remember - the whole POINT of LN (and sidechains) is that ""miners are useless, satoshi was wrong, we need a Proof of Stake system in bitcoin (LN, but controlled by the devs not miners)"".

Here's a funny thing, if a PoS system took hold in LNCoin (once known as Bitcoin/BTC), would you want to play with such a coin if someone told you that there are roughly 1million coins (btc) waiting in the shadows, with the probability that the controllers of said coins would not be impressed with how BTC got turned into LNCoin.",dtijplo,2,1/31/2018 6:10,,,,,,

WikiTextBot,"**Connectivity (graph theory)**

In mathematics and computer science, connectivity is one of the basic concepts of graph theory: it asks for the minimum number of elements (nodes or edges) that need to be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes from each other. It is closely related to the theory of network flow problems. The connectivity of a graph is an important measure of its resilience as a network.

AcerbLogic,"&gt; You post the same document draft that is disputed....  

Did you just look at the URL and not follow the link? I'm not referring to the subject of that thread, but a comment I happened to make in it.  

Here, I'll quote the comment, below:  

&gt; Excellent question. Here's what I'm going by:  
&gt; 
&gt; https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork  
&gt; 
&gt; and an [archive](http://archive.is/XuDVG) since this is a potentially censored source. Or this explanation works as well:  
&gt; 
&gt; http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/30817/what-is-a-soft-fork  
&gt; 
&gt; and its [archive](http://archive.is/o3r7c).  
&gt; 
&gt; The archive of the wiki link was made some time ago. I haven't checked to see if the live site has been edited since then. I'm going by what's stated in the archived version.  
&gt; 
&gt; Since this can get involved, I'll give you the TL;DR: I think just about everyone agrees that soft forks are where the changes are only further restrictions of previously existing rules -- never expansions of previously restricted functions (which would be hard forks). Said another way, soft forks are always backwards compatible.  
&gt; 
&gt; Given that, here are several ways to see that SegWit is a disguised hard fork:  
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Before SegWit activated, any network participant that saw an anyone-can-spend transaction could legitimately spend that transaction and still remain on the same chain as all other clients that agreed to these rules. If a change removes this ability, it is not backwards compatible. So, after SegWit activates and a SegWit transaction is seen by a legacy node, it legitimately chooses to spend that anyone-can-spend transaction. If that spend is mined into a subsequent block (by miners running legacy code), that results in any clients following legacy rules being forked off from the SegWit chain. But legacy clients *made no changes* to their code or rules, so the code changes that caused this hard fork are entirely due to SegWit.  
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Prior to SegWit activation, all nodes could fully validate all transactions all the way back to the genesis block. This is the essential capability that allows Bitcoin's trustlessness. If SegWit were truly a soft fork and thus backwards compatible, this capability would remain for legacy nodes after SegWit activation. But once SegWit transactions start to get mined, legacy clients no longer have this capability: ergo SegWit is a hard fork.  
&gt; 
&gt; 3) SegWit activation redefines what ""blocks"" are (i.e. ""block weight"" and witness data segregation). This is a blatant expansion of previously existing rules, not simply a restriction. Therefore, SegWit is a hard fork.  
&gt; 
&gt; EDIT: Got a bit more specific.  
&gt; 
&gt; EDIT 2: Also forgot to mention that SegWit adds new transaction types, also blatantly hard-fork behavior.  

---------

&gt; Will a node with version smaller than 0.13.0 be part of bitcoin cash or bitcoin network?  

Neither, it'd be part of a chain that is currently abandoned: a continuation of the non-SegWit 1 MB block size limit chain. Of course, it would follow the SegWit (BTC) chain *until* someone spends an anyone-can-spend SegWit transaction to an address other than the intended SegWit recipient. That's what would instigate the actual chain fork. If anyone were to invest the hash power to do this (and it would be quite substantial, for reference, take a look at what ""Clashic"" fork trolls have invested so far), they'd have to spend one of those anyone-can-spend transactions immediately to kick off their own chain.  

Re: P.S.: I don't see any links or proof from you to support your claims that any draft was changed. Pretty typical in my experience from those that espouse your positions.

thieflar,"There is really not much need to fear hub-and-spoke topology of upper layers, anyway. I expect some hubs to naturally develop, when particular service providers offer consistently spectacular service to end-users and attract widespread demand as a result. And this is not a bad thing.

One of the reasons why Lightning Network is such an attractive solution is because it allows **Bitcoin**, the layer *beneath* it, to remain maximally decentralized. It itself can centralize somewhat without having much of a negative impact on the protocol; the plan has *always* been to build the quick, easy, user-friendly, flexible stuff *on top* of the rock-solid base layer beneath. We can admit centralization (or other stuff like fraud-protection through payment reversibility, or Turing complete expressivity) into the second (or third, or fourth) layers, experimenting with the various models, until we have a fully fleshed out infrastructure supporting all manner of use cases while keeping our foundations as secure and sound as possible.

Anyone who tries to whine about Lightning Network being ""too centralized"" is inadvertently admitting that they haven't *gotten it* yet. Bitcoin is the foundation, it's the layer we want to be simple, pure, efficient, decentralized, and *minimal*, while the fancy or ""trade-offy"" stuff is hosted on top of it.

Any engineer worth their salt will tell you the same, assuming they have a halfway-decent understanding of the network and its purpose.

PopeJohnXXII,"&gt;does Bitcoin Cash have a roadmap? 

Roadmap for 2018

https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-cash-abc-bu-announce-roadmap-2018

During a meeting in London about the 2018 roadmap, there were 7 teams: Bitcoin ABC, Bitcrust, Bitprim, Bitcoin Unlimited, ElectrumX, nChain, and Parity.

""For the next hard fork upgrade ABC has the following features in mind:

Increase the block size further and move towards an ‚Äúadaptive block size limit,‚Ä?similar to what Bitcoin Unlimited already has,Move toward canonical transaction order, which could be important to enable future scaling technologies like Graphene,further improve the difficulty adjustment algorithm,and reactivate some disabled opcodes.

The so-called ‚Äúopcodes‚Ä?are commands of Bitcoin‚Äôs internal script language, which is mostly used to validate transactions. For reasons of security, Satoshi disabled some code in Bitcoin‚Äôs early days. To explore the features Bitcoin is missing by the disabling, ABC wants to reactivate these opcodes carefully.

Similar, but reaching further, is the roadmap of Bitcoin Unlimited. The developers announced that they will support the two hard forks in 2018.

Besides having already implemented an adaptive block size limit, BU suggests to further increase capacity by decreasing block intervals to one, two, or 2.5 minutes. This should enhance the user experience at the same time,Like ABC, BU supports the reactivation of old opcodes but also proposes to implement new codes, like OP_GROUP or OP_DATASIGVERIFY, which could enable ‚Äúrepresentative token and binary contracts,‚Ä?among other things,BU agrees with ABC to announce a new address format, to reduce confusion, which results of users sending Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin addresses. A new format called Cashaddr was recently suggested by ABC. It is based on Pieter Wuille‚Äôs bech32 format,Further, BU wants to evaluate the implementation of ‚ÄúBobtail,‚Ä?which has the potential to ‚Äúreduce inter-block time variance, increase double-spend resistance, improve the DDA, and achieve better mining,‚ÄùAlso, BU wants to evaluate the implementation of Graphene.

The roadmaps which come together, are dedicated and pick up some new ideas which circulate the talk about scaling Bitcoin. Graphene and Bobtail have just recently been discussed on the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop in Stanford; they have the potential to make Bitcoin scale better in several areas. ""

From this roadmap, the new Cashadrr has already been implemented.

UnbitterFeelings,"They determine when to sell the stock based on my response above - observation, news, interpretation and experience.

How do they differentiate between stocks? They look at the nature of the stock and the activity of it. They monitor the market to see what stocks are being traded frequently and has a lot of trading volume (so that there are enough number of stocks going around to buy/sell).

An example is bitcoin. Bitcoin has a lot of buy/sell activity in any given day. As you would have seen everywhere on the internet, there is a lot of chatter about it and a lot of interest in it. Because it‚Äôs being traded so many times in one day, its price fluctuates far more compared to a stock in, let‚Äôs say, a pharmaceutical company that doesn‚Äôt have much interest on most days.

But if said pharmaceutical, for example, announced that it has found a cure to cancer, that will generate a lot of interest in its stock and people want to get their hands on that stock quickly. So that generates market activity. But if FDA announces later that the drug is not safe for humans, that also generates market activity, in that people want to sell those quickly to minimise any losses.

More market activity would lead to more price fluctuations. Which is why they look on their scanners to see what‚Äôs a ‚Äúhotly traded‚Ä?stock for the day. ",dtija85,2,1/31/2018 5:55,,,,,,

Fachuro,"Everyone predicting the Cryptobubble have completely misunderstood the disruption and movement that is happening that has lead to this anyways...  Sure there will be more downswings and governments and establishment will probably fight this as hard as they possibly can because they realise what it is, but essentially what we're facing is a Fiat-bubble, not a crypto-bubble.

More and more wealth every year is amassing in a smaller and smaller circle of people across the globe, they own everything in the capitalist society and the average wages of workers all over the world whilst being artifically increased by inflation and the printing of money is decreasing compared to the average prices of the purchase of goods.

Crypto and decentralizing services and goods is a modern day revolution and disrupting this systems, it brings power and wealth back to the people because it cannot be controlled and manipulated in the same way by the big businesses.  You talk about whales manipulating prices in crypto?  That's nothing compared to how regular markets are being manipulated by businesses.

As adoption increases and more dapps are built to replace and disrupt traditional services being controlled by corporations we're infact taking back our wealth and redistributing it, because ANYONE can be a cryptoinvestor.  And that's also why it's so important what we're seeing right now, the rise of the altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is going down, further decentralizing the market and making it harder and harder for someone to manipulate and control the cryptomarket.

The more coins in the market the better.

Eventually the bubble will pop - the fiat bubble - and mass adoption will cause the majority of wealth to be distributed through the cryptoverse and being completely decentralized...

Just look in the media how terrified the establishment is getting of crypto, and how desperately they are attempting to spread FUD about the cryptomarket - they know they are losing control, and they know a big change to society is happening.",dtij7u3,2,1/31/2018 5:53,,,,,,

Risk is extremely high no matter what you do, so might as well have a chance to really make it big.

It's actually 1-MB-gatekeeper-BTC that only allows large miners to survive. With $30 transaction fees, only large miners earn enough to let them withdraw their mining revenues with any regularity.

With Bitcoin Cash, small miners can actually use pools and withdraw their funds on a regular basis.

Ethereum has no limit. So what is your point?

Having 2bn dollars in cash laying around is EXTREMELY rare. Especially when non of the team members have any reason to have such an amount. Remember: All in all there are around 1500 billionaires in the world and imagining any of them have been like: ""Oh... You guys want to make a stablecoin? Sure here you have 2bn dollars"" is such an absurd idea that it's not even worth persuing. A lot of Fortune 500 companies wouldn't even have 2bn in cash laying around. It's simply ludicrous to assume. 

So what has Tether done? One theory is that Tether has bought Bitcoin with the cash from the sale of Tether. The logic would be that Tether would survive and  be liquid as long as the price of Bitcoin rise. The reason for this is not just speculation. There has been seen correlating bitcoin buys from a bitfinex accounts that strangely correlates with Tether printing. If this is true Tether's bitcoin buys can account for almost 50% of all price rises in Bitcoin lately. Now then what happens when Tether sell because of people wanting their money back? Bitcoin starts spiraling and we see one of the biggest crashes in a long time. Seems far out? Well. If you believe Tether has 2bn dollars laying around then that's fair.

Rawman411,"I‚Äôm just guessing but if people who owns btc like say 40000 btc then they will receive 40000 btcp. Would they just dump? Not necessary. If I was bob with 40000 btcp I would put in a large buy order when the coin first release. As a whale the price will go up. It‚Äôs not just bob pumping the price, most active btc whales will join.

Anyways basically they can pump the price up and then sell their free btcp when the price is higher. Then the price will go back down.

This to me is the different between other non btc forks. Btc holders have tremendous buying power and they have nothing to lose with free coins.

However since bitcoin isn‚Äôt as private anymore some will hold their btcp or even buy back for the long run.

Of course this is all a guess. But from previous forks bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold I feel that this will be somewhat similar.",dtiiw1j,2,1/31/2018 5:41,,,,,,

1CoolKid,"Depends on what you want to archieve. Moneywise, nobody can tell you. You could look at the statistics. Myriad used to have an ATH of 6 cent, before the ""crash"" it was moving around 2-3 cents. It did not have any serious P&amp;D as far as I'm informed. 
Invest what you can afford to lose. Dont hope for a moonshot. Myriad needs time if it is going to make it.
But, very beneficial in terms of information. Many active people who are happy to share there knowledge etc. 
Myriad made me look deeper into crypto. I been watching nearly all Andreas Antonopoulos (well known Bitcoin advocate) video, since he mentioned Myriad in his book.
Hope this helps!

The current bitcoin community? I doubt that. If the price does crash 90% from here, many people trying to mix into the HODLers' community will get flush out due to their fear.

constantin_md,"market cap is price of crypto times total supply. It's not total worth, you can't pull out $173 billion from btc's current market cap if let's say everyone would want to abandon it. theoretically, on Gdax price of BTC would currently go down to $5k  if only 13000 bitcoin were sold at once. ($100 mil out ) In practice the price would go a lot lower because every single stop loss order would be triggered. Gdax is a big exchange. a few more hundred millions pulled out from other exchanges and market cap of btc would go down to theoretical 1/2 of current 173 billion. or in practice probably crash to a few millions. Something similar with a lot less money pulled out happened to Ethereum when price went down briefly a few cents from ~$300 last summer.

where-is-satoshi,"You make a legitimate point regarding the treatment of RBF TX and an attempted double spend. Perhaps with the slight difference in treatment of the customer. As RBF is built into the wallet, it may be sent by accident for example and the customer given the benefit of the doubt and perhaps directed to view store policy as you mention. The double spend customer has to go to special lengths to attempt a double spend and should be treated as a thief and detained. You are incorrect regarding the reliability of 0-conf on the BCH chain. I bought drinks last week whereupon the merchant accepted 0-conf. In fact every merchant I know accepts 0-conf. On an un-congested network-by-design it is remarkably safe to use and double spend attempts easily detected by the merchant in any case.  In practice, the perp is risking jail over what can only amount to be petty theft. Larger spends you simply confirm.
I also disagree that ""today we have technologies like lightening"" - we haven't. LN is a long way from prime time and unlikely to enjoy the scaling capacity that Bitcoin Cash already enjoys, especially with its silly 1MB BTC blocksize limit or any scalable solution to the routing problem. Blockstream/core also blundered by driving off their merchant base instead of keeping them and rolling them into LN when it is mature. I personally think BTC is finished as it may have already conceded the network effect advantage to Bitcoin Cash. Now it's just becomes a matter of time. ",dtiii2p,2,1/31/2018 5:27,,,,,,

friendzis,"Definitely not. Blockchain was **not** invented by Bitcoin. In essence blockchain is ordered/chained (by timestamp, id, sequence number, content hash does not matter) list of blocks (heh) containing some binary blob and metadata. When metadata contains hash of previous block, changes to any block avalanche through consecutive blocks and it becomes statistically improbable to change anything in the chain without last hash changing, or in other words by knowing first/origin/genesis block and hash of last known-good block one can verify that the chain (history) was not tampered with. The contents of the binary blob (buttcoin transactions, source code version, chat messages) are completely tangential to blockchain. The earliest and most primitive form of blockchain I can think of is TCP packets, if you allow checksums to be primitive form of a hash. TCP is of course not designed to be tamper-proof, but can be considered ancestor of blockchain.

Important sidenote. Due to resistance to preimage attacks of modern cryptographic hash functions, chaining blocks by hash is more or less equivalent to embedding entire contents of previous block. Essentially you have content addressable memory.

Buttcoin is more or less collection of good ideas applied to a particular domain. In my view, the biggest innovation bitcoin brought is the ""useless computation as proof of work"" distributed trustless consensus algorithm. Most commonly useless computations are used as defense tactic, e.g. to make problem NP-Complete for attacker in password hashing. Essentially bitcoin treats nodes as permanent attackers and tries to self balance. The consequences of that are low transaction confirmation times, low throughput, etc.. These problems are consequence of design.",dtiiffy,2,1/31/2018 5:24,,,,,,

Kessarean,"&gt; You definitely weren't looking then.

I couldn't find it, therefore I never looked? I'm still hungry, therefore I never ate? I'm not tired, therefore I never really worked? Just because there is a lack of a result, doesn't mean effort was not put in. Failure is a consequence of action - to say that a result without the expected outcome implies no effort is preposterous. But, you're welcome to think whatever you may, in the end it's all a matter of perspective. I work very odd hours and long weeks, I don't have time to spend all day waiting for the right price on a card. When I was off I tried to keep up with nowinstock for about a month, but could never get there for sales due to my schedule. I checked other platforms as well, and signed up for alerts, but the same scenario. Maybe you have more time to kill, not everyone does.  

Like I said, if you find a way to get a good deal - great. No reason to be a douchebag about it.  People said the same thing about bitcoin, people are proven wrong every day. I'm not an economist - but in the near future, I don't see prices going down. If they do - oh well, for me it was a good buy. The extra $200 is worth my time. I got what I came for. Value is in the eye of the beholder. If me spending $200 dollars above MSRP in an inflated market is the worst expense you've have ever seen, you really need to get out more. 

&gt;prices are going to keep going higher, there's no way that could possibly happen from an economic standpoint. 

Maybe it will, maybe it won't. I'm inclined to think that it will, block chain technology is really starting to take off, at it's core is a decentralized currency that can be farmed from your desk. Crypto currencies are slowly being accepted on a wide range of platforms. Their future is a mystery, but in the immediate months, I think they'll stay on the rise - but you're welcome to disagree. 

You've been really rude this entire thread anyways. Why should I take anything you have to say seriously? All of your comments are just arguing against me, saying I'm wrong on just about any point I make, calling me a fool and other callous remarks. Why not offer something other than banter and off handed jests to the conversation. Offer some evidence even, how is it possible that this (prices continuing to go up) couldn't happen? Explain why, I am genuinely curious. What's going to stop video cards from going the same path as RAM? Let's come back in 2 months and check prices. I would be happy to be wrong.

sauce_bearnaise,"I'd say trusting transactions and trusting the ledger integrity are kinda the same thing, especially for a purely transactional ledger like bitcoin, since you only require the knowledge of past transactions on the ledger in order to validate the current transactions.
For smart contracts blockchains like ethereum, the business logic between all parties in a contract is more complicated than a simple asset transaction, and may require external information. Here you don't put your trust in a ledger per se but in computer code. In that view, the legal system is bypassed by computer code, so that suing should not be necessary as the contract would execute automatically. Obviously that would most directly apply to digital assets. But overall the point is that if you trust the ledger/code, you don't need to trust the other parties. And consensus algorithms enable this.
For private/permissioned blockchains, you choose the counter-parties involved, so there's less risk, but it does not mean that they can be fully trusted so still need some kind of consensus algorithm. Hence my initial question. Surely you know the participants so you could sue in real life if needed, if you are able to detect it that is...but having a consensus algorithm in place should avoid misbehavior in the first place (provided 2/3 of the participants behave correctly or something like that). At least that's how i understand it, not sure if that clarifies or blurs your thoughts Mannie...

chue-li,"The transaction throughput is for the neo blockchain itself and all assets and tokens running on it. Neo and Gas are so called global assets on the blockchain working with a utxo model similar to bitcoin and are processed directly on the blockchain while NEP5 tokens are managed by smart contracts similar to ERC20 tokens. If NEO reaches 100‚Ä?00 tx/s you can make 100‚Ä?00 transactions of global assets and/or NEP5 tokens. 
This is possible because of the dBFT consensus mechanism which is very different to POW and POS. Basically it works like this: one of the consensus nodes gets elected as a speaker (randomly afaik) and broadcasts every transaction that it receives to all the other consensus nodes as a new block. If more than 66% of consensus nodes aggree with the broadcasted block it gets written on the blockchain. If no consensus is reached then the next consensus node broadcasts a new block until a consensus is reached.

ForkiusMaximus,"The myth I addressed is that a particular miner publishing a larger-than-normal block or block that takes a long time to propagate gives them an advantage.

If Pacia was instead just talking about bigger blocks and slower propagation in general, as far as I can see any such effect is debatable and negligible if it even exist, until massively larger blocksizes come about, and do so due to natural demand. 

Positing 5% network orphan rate on a sustained basis (which would be because smaller mining pools don't even find it profitable to upgrade their networking to reduce their bottlenecking effect on the orphan rate) is positing massive demand due to massive popularity resulting in massive blocks. However, as that necessarily entails massive popularity (since simply producing a huge block without demand just loses the miner money), the hypothetical increase in centralization is itself called into question. Massive increase in popularity, massively more entrants into the mining industry, massively less proportionate costs going to networking. That is *de*centralization, even if certain individual miners will be put out of business. At least as long as the additional networking costs are offset by the increase in Bitcoin usage, which seems likely to be the case for quite a few more orders of magnitude in blocksize.",dtihmm2,2,1/31/2018 4:52,,,,,,

keymone,"&gt; You seem to be making assumptions, how can you know they all using fast sync?

it's not an assumption, it's a conclusion i made from plethora of comments and issues from people not being able to do a full sync. you can find it in google fairly easily.

&gt; adding this feature could increase Bitcoin nodes up to 9x

the goal shouldn't be maximising number of nodes (at some point there is just enough to ensure reliable propagation of transactions and block headers), it should be keeping cost of running a node in check. atm cost of running eth node is much higher.

&gt; The topology is dynamic, nodes need to broadcast their status (not only presence but liquidity, etc..) each time a transaction is made

you replied with that to me refuting your own words that ""Bitcoin node broadcasts they don‚Äôt have to find a route"" - are you trying to refute yourself? took mah job!

&gt; Certainly, time will tell if they can stay independent.

for sure time will tell, but the attitude on this sub is as if that is already a fact.

&gt; FUD suggests I lied about the limitations

no, FUD is *fear*, *uncertainty* and *doubt*. it is FUD to be claiming the ""always online"" limitation is a blocker to LN adoption, which you yourself have confirmed is ""Overblown maybe"".

&gt; Can you elaborate, all the data I know suggests the opposite

very easy: the higher the cost to run a node, the more people on the low end will decide not to do that (do not want to invest in more hardware/bandwidth/etc). as people on low end disconnect, the average network hardware/bandwidth/etc *goes up*, which will support higher demand with lower fees, driving even more lower-cost participants out. rinse and repeat - you're stuck with nodes only running expensive hardware out of datacenters controlled by large corporations.

&gt; On block rewards is gone fees will need to remain beyond $20-80 to sustainable a reasonable amount of POW.

well guess what, having a fee market *helps* during halfenings because the revenue lost from coinbase is offset by higher fees. of course least efficient miners will be pushed out, but that will be more extreme on BCH chain because nothing offsets the revenue lost.

RG_PankO,"&gt; The truth is that the bitcoin price is a random number generator and putting a significant chunk of your savings into it is very very risky.

Absolutely correct. That's why I haven't put most of my money in Bitcoin.  
However I've put enough that in the next 12 months even if it goes to 25k and I sell at that price it would net me more ""interest"" than all the deposits I have currently in my bank accounts.  
As the interest rate of banks is so low and I don't have enough to purchase a property, I just prefer to put 10% or so in Bitcoin.
Worse case scenario - I lose 10% of my savings. I am young, don't have that much savings anyway, and losing 10% would be like if I took an expensive trip somewhere.  
However, if Bitoin bounces up - as it always has so far, it would literally make me more profit than all my other savings are accumulating for me right now.",dtihi84,2,1/31/2018 4:46,,,,,,

The way they said it was confrontational and belittling, but it's still the right approach. You are trying to MAKE money here, not lose it. This bubble has not really been about bitcoin or crypto, it's been about a media-fuelled bubble. It's once again demonstrated how crazy/dumb people get when they think they can make a fast buck. It makes sense to me that we'll see a very negative opinion of crypto for a fairly long time now. Especially once you get informed and see there's really not much of a future for it. It won't die. And it might bubble again (far higher even). Look/wait for the next halving. But it'll probably just go back to being fairly useless. It probably has brought in a new swathe of gamblers though.

5tu,"A hashing algorithm is lots of bit logic to essentially create a function F such that the output looks random but is deterministic.  What that means is if I put the value '1' into the hash, I get say the value 4568347 returned.  Every time anyone puts '1' in to that same hash function they will also get the same 4568347 returned. 


If however I put '2' in I get another random number like '3182345'.  


The trick is there is no short cut or reversable way to associate the output to the input of a hash other than doing the actual hash calculation.  I.e. you have to keep guessing random numbers on the input that produce an output &lt; difficulty.  

It takes a while to get your head around it but basically it doesn't matter if you increment the nonce, change the header by adding more transactions, change the timestamp, etc... they all have exactly the same effect of just giving you another guess at finding a valid mining answer where the result is less than the difficulty target to be considered a 'found block'.  

So typically miners will pick some random number to start the nonce on (or start at 0) and increment from there.  Anytime they can pick up a new transaction the nonce could restart from 0 or they can just keep counting up, makes no odds really.  

I.e. each combination of tx set, nonce, timestamp, extranonce is just 1 guess.  Clearly the bitcoin network does exaillion guesses per second so the network on average finds a winner only once every 10 minutes on average.

The take away is this. Lightning network is complex. Hugely complex with many known known concerns and probably more unknown unknowns. 1 billion users, topping up their payment channels, evenly distributed over a month once a month, could get away with something like 32meg blocks and all associated risks with keys, being online, watchers, insurance structures to ensure you can afford to pay the fee to counteract a defraud etc. So you need bigger blocks anyway for this to be remotely viable, and even then there are huge security concerns and it will still be limited to those of us wealthy enough to settle on-chain once a month or so.

Poikanen,"If your criticisms are largely baseless, you will get downvoted. From the looks of it, bitcoin scaling issues won't be solved anytime soon. As I understand it LN isn't really a bitcoin solution, but rather an additional 3rd party solution that adds extra complexity and vulnerabilities. And it will never be feeless. As a currency, I don't see bitcoin doing anything more than XRB. Of course XRB has to be proven, but if it holds up, it simply is superior technology for a currency. Ease of use and cost are the cornerstones of currency.

The mining schedule shortage and following centralization claim is bs. The coin was distributed by a captcha faucet, so the distribution was much more decentralized than bitcoin. Anyone could do it and it wasn't just a matter of spending money on a node to do the work for you. Bitcoin mining in comparison has become very centralized and LN will probably become too.

If running a node is cheap, the need for incentives is a lot smaller. In bitcoin if you want to participate in securing the network you need to do very expensive PoW and that's why it needs to be incentiviced so much. It not the same for XRB. Anyway the devs have said incentives in some form are being worked on. 

In conclusion much of the critisizm is bs or the comparisons are unfair. Real critisizm on the technology is very welcome, such as the DoS vulnerability. Also the desktop wallet is fugly and we can hope the exchange problems are over.",dtiha1q,2,1/31/2018 4:37,,,,,,

namastex,"The bear market has nothing to do with weak hands. People who are selling aren't selling everything, just a partial to reap in some of the profit they made to get ready for tax season and to buy in dips during the predicted bear market. They are coming back and they aren't leaving for good. The smartest time is to sell in mid December through early January.

The bear market is because there isn't as much new money flowing into the market as it was during the middle of a fiscal quarter. This means, bonus checks (extra money) from heavy spenders. The majority of people getting bonus checks in the 4th quarter get them early, around the end of Nov to mid December for holidays. The reason the 4th quarter jumped started the market cap so much is because there are people who request to get all of their bonus money before holidays so they can have a bunch of extra cash during this time period. 

You will see that there are guaranteed 4 massive pumps through out the year, and this is based off of bonus checks (people's extra money that exceeds their annual/quarterly budget). The first fiscal quarter is always going to be the lowest pump in terms of the other 3 quarters since this time is around tax season. The bigger spenders pay in taxes resulting in them having less money to spend lavishly.

The average dates of when people get their bonuses is smack dab in the middle of each fiscal quarter. That's in the middle of March, June, September and December. Go ahead and take some time to look back at the larger/older cryptos and notice that they peak at these times, or close to them. Then take into consideration, that once people pump their money into bitcoin, ethereum and etc., they move their money into alt coins shortly after they see the fall off of the major coins, which is anywhere from 2 weeks to a month later. That's why you see alt coins spike shortly after the ATH of the major coins. 

Remember that even coins like ETH were once considered small time alt coins and if you follow this idea, you can go back every year all the way to 2015 and you'll see this pattern, skip 2014 you will see this pattern further back. End of 2014 and early 2015 is a weird anomaly in the history of crypto due to the big MtGox scandal, which is the only thing that throws off my analysis. 

Once the market looks bear and ATH's seem to come to a crawl, many people will take their money out so they can buy the dips. The professional's who do analysis for years also take their money out ahead of time to buy into these dips. It's just the common flow of discretionary income.",dtigt92,2,1/31/2018 4:16,,,,,,

CanadianCryptoGuy,"Right.  False value is irrelevant in accounting terms (I'm trained as an accountant) unless they have been used as collateral to be secured against financing, or as a balance sheet item.  ""Fake"" tethers that have been ""issued"" but are still sitting in the computer at Tether Inc. are completely irrelevant to the marketplace.  The only thing they affect is the numbers on CoinMarketCap, and that's a false metric if they aren't actually trading.

For them to have any actual effect in the markets, they would have needed to be put into circulation.  In order to do that, since the price has been fairly effectively collared (mostly between 98 cents and $1.02 weighted average), then when they went into circulation, the entity that created them (Tether Inc.) must have received an asset in return.  Unless Tether subsequently unwound any such assets, there is no risk.

Let me give you a simple example.  I create 100 quadrillion PoopCoins.  I then sell you fifty of those coins for a dollar each, and promise you that I will redeem all outstanding PoopCoins for a dollar each.  If I'm still holding onto the rest of the PoopCoins, my obligation is $50 rather than $100 quadrillion.  Yes, absolutely, if I don't still hold the $50 that you gave me for your PoopCoins, and you ask for them all to be redeemed at once, then I'm screwed.  But hopefully when I sold them to you for $50, I kept the money in my bank account.

The only obvious stupidity that I could have engaged in to lose my $50 would be if I had decided to ""invest"" it into Bitcoin at $19,000, and now Bitcoin is trading at $10,000.  So if you ask for your money back, then I have to sell my Bitcoin immediately to come up with the $50 to pay you back.  But since BTC is worth about half of what I paid for it, then I'm fucked.

If ALL the Tethers had been released to the markets when BTC was trading at $19k, I'd be worried right now.  Monumental stupidity would then be possible.  But if you look at the times that Tether was released, then Tether can't have lost enough to cause a big problem.  In fact, some of the times that Tether was released are correlated to times when BTC was at a lower value than the current market price, so Tether Inc. probably made a ton of money with those, if they actually traded their assets for BTC.

So that goes back to what I thought before.  The people who issued the Tethers, regardless of whether or not the full 2.2 billion are actually in circulation, received assets as they released those tokens.  Unless they diverted funds to something else, or spent it on hookers and blow, then I see very little risk of a bank run that could systemically wipe them out.",dtigqnl,2,1/31/2018 4:13,,,,,,

fbaseller1,"I am not going to keep talking to you about this because I still think your wrong on nearly every point above. I am not talking about sending an automatic currency payment, i am talking about programmable money, the money itself knows when to release when a contract is complete and to who. You cannot do this with real money, real money does not have any in built mechanism to do it. As I said you would need people, time and money to build just one contract mechanism on top of money, the point is this will be built in, a generic system that doesn't need all of the above. I don't know how you can't get that, I can't say to someone right heres ¬£50 ill put it here, you complete X work and that will auto get sent to you. The only way I could currently do that is by hiring people, or paying a company to sort that out, that is not what this is. 

You are very close minded, I am not talking about this stuff happening tomorrow I am talking about the future. The blockchain will become much bigger than just bitcoin as I said before, this technology will not just be for currency, every argument you have above is based on now and bitcoin, personally I don't care for bitcoin, it will be taken over sooner or later by the Facebook of Crypto, everyone who is into this stuff knows that. It has its flaws most of which are already fixed with other coins. 

Again the system is unstable AT THE MOMENT. I am talking years down the line, 20-30 years even. We are right at the beginning of the internet in blockchain terms. What have you got against the public ledger I don't get it? It is good to have an unchangeable record of every transaction? That is the purpose so data is not just disposed of immediately, I am not sure why you think thats a good idea. There will be a burst, which will be good it will stabilise the currencies and then build to its true value. Of course things are unstable currently just because of fluctuation however currencies transfers in crypto are MUCH safer than using a bank or any other method of payment, the only times you here about money being stolen is when an exchange got hacked like 2 years ago, but people in the future will not keep their money in online exchanges. The network itself cannot be hacked and as I said instead of X company being hacked that had 2 million credit cards on file, people would have to go after 2 million individual people pretty much making that kind of attack extinct.

Lastly once this stuff becomes more mainstream they will fix the double spending issue and as I said most of these flaws are already fixed with different coins, and as I said above bitcoin will not be the future, things that are faster and cheaper already exist, bitcoin is just the ""myspace"" brand currently. 

And the who the hell is going to get 51% control of all mining just to stop the network for a bit? You would need an insane amount of money, time and power to just cause a bit of an upset, again this is just something anti blockchain I think you have read. You started off saying they could steal everyone's money, right there you shown you haven't done your research.

Also again you are wrong about transferring money, it is slower because you need third party checkers in the background especially when you are sending large sums of money across countries. This will always be the case with banks and they will always charge for the process. This is the whole point to be in control of your money, you obviously see no personal use for crypto and the blockchain right now and you are happy using a bank so you dismiss it. As I said before there are millions of people that this will change their lifes, they will never get banking, their currencies are messed up as it is, just because we don't use it right now doesn't mean millions of others won't. 

Anyway it seems like your not even bothering to read outside of some video you have watched that was anti blockchain so I  won't be replying again. You are literally following all the people in history that said ""hey we don't need this we already have a way to do it, Im happy with that"", tons of life changing inventions people could not have predicted and would have said they didn't need, but they now use every single day.

iago_bot,"My problem with XRB (please correct me if I'm wrong) is that you can choose your auditors of your own blockchain yourself. The weight they are given is based on their account balance. So basically people with lot's of money could forge their own blockchains for smaller accounts with a certain probability and there would be (again with a certain probability) no way to ever catch or notice this kind of attack. If somebody made a 50+1 attack on Bitcoin Cash, you would know roughly 10 minutes later (probably).  

Basically, while standard POW methods like BCH are prone to 50+1 Hashpower attacks (which is very unlikely to achieve), XRP is prone to both 50+1 Hashpower **and** 50+1 Stake attacks. As stated in their whitepaper:

&gt; The   metric   of   consensus   for   RaiBlocks   is   a   balance weighted  voting  system.  If  an  attacker  is  able  to  gain  over 50%  of  the  voting  strength,  they  can  cause  the  network  to oscillate consensus rendering the system broken

In my opinion 50% of the entire stake (especially since it was very cheap in November) is definitely achievable and may be already the case.

Apart from the latter concerns, I am not convinced how they want to solve the **precomputed POW attack**, since in my opinion the only way to solve it would be to limit the transaction rate, or time which would render XRB useless since it is their selling argument. 

Furthermore, **XRB is not permission-less**  since you can take anyone off the network by DDosing them with Penny Transactions. This attack works especially well for people with bad computers since they have to perform POW on their own chain for each small transaction.

Finally, the wallet. I got pretty good computer but the wallet took longer than 2 weeks to sync. The solution offered online was to download the chain from some shady looking website... not very professional in my opinion. 

So: [TLDR of my opinion](https://giphy.com/gifs/election2016-debate-presidential-2016-26uf2JHNV0Tq3ugkE).

 &gt;Hey  [r/Bitcoin](/r/Bitcoin) ,

&gt;I will be visiting NYC for a long weekend soon and I would like to spend some coins while I am there. 

&gt;Can anyone recommend some shops that accept bitcoin? Like bars and restaurants or other brick&amp;mortar shops. 

&gt;I googled it but maybe someone here knows of some spots that aren't on yelp or on the first page of google.

&gt;Thanks!",dtiglnn,2,1/31/2018 4:07,,,,,,

FrontDeskGuy95,"To 14 year old me, 

Don't be so angry about everything. It's not your fault you were poor, it was no one's fault. Don't think that the whole world is against you, there are people who are willing to help you. Go visit Grandpapa more often, he won't be here much longer and you will be crushed when he passes because I didn't make the effort to see him and spend time with him. To this day it's one of my biggest regrets.

Don't be afraid to try something new. Sushi, it's fucking great. Please don't wait till you're 19 to try it. Granted you can't afford it right now but as soon as you can, please try it. Don't take the tenner out of dad's wallet the day before Aidan's 16th birthday. That was all dad had left for that whole week. Go and say sorry to dad because you are an insufferable, unappreciative cunt. He loves you and cares a lot about you but you constantly tell him that you hate him because of our financial situation. I once again say, it wasn't his fault. You will understand the circumstances when you are about 18 or so.

In about 5 years you are going to meet a beautiful woman. Let me tell you a little about her. She will treat you right, be your friend and be part of your life forever, I hope. You will make a mistake of asking her to be a friend with benefits. You will almost blow your chance with her but she will accept. Just be a man and ask her out instead. Don't be a muppet and suggest something like that. Also, you will become Aidan's legal guardian at 20 because Aidan and Priscilla will move to separate countries in Asia for work. Be prepared, raising a 2-year-old is hard.

Make sure you go to the 2015 SF Auto Show. Trust me, you will thank me. That person will become a friend and get you pretty good tickets to his band's rock show a lot. Be prepared to get into a very bad motorcycle accident in late 2014. You will break your metacarpals in your right hand and will not be able to play the guitar for almost a year. Instead of going to Hugh's place the normal way, take the longer route instead. Just trust me. The accident wasn't pretty.

Lastly, please be a nicer person. When I look back at what I used to be, I regret every moment of it. Please. Oh and please buy more Bitcoin. You didn't get enough.

Best of luck,


23 year old you.

But how are you not seeing the value in something like Tether? Of course it never rises in value. That's literally the beauty of it. Wouldn't you want the chance to save your profits from being diminished? Or the opportunity to increase your coin amount without investing more money? It isn't a coin people invest in to hold onto, it's just short term to increase/protect their investments. Plus when you really think of it, there actually is real value in a coin that isn't volatile. Bitcoin was supposed to be a currency people actually use. But now because people are making money by holding their coins, nobody is ever using/spending their cryptocurrency. Cryptos have become like stock investments instead of actual currency. I know I never EVER spend any of my Cryptos, because I know they will make me money in the long run. I'd only ever spend cryptocurrency once I know there isn't money to be made anymore.

steerio,"That must be the memo ID/memo text you're talking about. That's something entirely different.

Stellar accounts have a minimum balance, so exchanges opt not to have a distinct one for each and every user. They have a couple of storage wallets instead, and when you deposit lumens, you have to somehow set the recipient.

Transactions on Stellar can have a memo attached to them, and they expect you to fill an internal wallet ID there. Now, this thing supports multiple data types, so you need to make sure to choose the right one.

Deposits in Ripple work in a similar fashion, except for the data type confusion.

(Adding this via an edit: keys themselves work like with any other crypto. If you generate an address in a browser-based wallet, you have to copy your key somewhere and keep it safe, whether it's Bitcoin or Stellar. You should not use such a solution to handle large funds. You can use a desktop/mobile wallet or a Ledger, in which case you don't juggle with your key at all, etc.)",dtigh04,2,1/31/2018 4:01,,,,,,

Agreed!

&gt; Raiblocks is an idea that probably won't work. It doesn't seem very plausible

For such a statement to have any merit you would have to elaborate.

What practical issues?

You're not _guaranteed_, but it is indeed pretty likely. But that is mostly a comparison between established adoption rather than technical merit.

&gt; Which is why we are beginning to see more base-pair offerings in other denominations. If most people had the option of utilizing XRP or XLM as a base exchange currency to any other coin, I can promise you they would. Who wouldn't want to pay transaction fees that are a fraction of a penny instead of fees north of $10 dollars or more? Also, both (XRP and XLM) are insanely fast, seconds not hours. IMHO, Bitcoin's days are numbered serving as the defacto base exchange currency, which is basically the only primary support to keep it afloat at its current price range. Japan's largest Securities Exchange (SBI Virtual Currencies) ""will use XRP as the only digital asset supported at launch"" as its base exchange currency for its 4 million retail and institutional customers. These exchanges will naturally gravitate to the most cost-efficient, frictionless, and scalable exchange route to preserve their bottom-line and lower transaction costs for their customers as well.

Um, I suppose the first thing you could do is show that they liquidated all the Bitcoin. 

The announcement that they received the BTC was like a day ago. If the first thing you do as a Foundation when you receive 91 Bitcoin is dump them to USD within 24 hours without even considering the potential upside of keeping some as an investment or staggering the sales, without board and committee meetings to reach consensus, or taking a moment to breath and wait for a market upswing, then I guess you are pretty irrational.

They *could* have already dumped all **91** (much wow!!), yesterday, but I doubt it. Even if they had, it is not a major factor in this bloodbath.

Bitconnect was a blatant scam and they pulled something similar. Do you think people directly benefiting from it will face any harsh consequences?

So if Coinbase get 18 mil $ per day then it would be enough to buy all the BTC at 10k each. Now what happen if Coinbase get 19 mil $? Then Coinbase has to increase the price in order to tempt sellers to sell their coins. This could mean even after 11k or 12k no sellers would like to sell and resulting more increase the bid.

Ant-n,"&gt;&amp;gt; Again then bloody why ETH got more nodes? 

&gt;but it doesn't. all available nodes are `geth --fast-sync`, they have not verified the blockchain, just accepted something as trustworthy and moved on building on top of that.

You seem to be making assumptions, how can you know they all using fast sync?

But if true, that‚Äôs great news that mean such optimisation should be given the highest priority in BTC, the number suggests (if what you say is true) adding this feature could increase Bitcoin nodes up to 9x.

People that can‚Äôt deal with the sync will still be better off running a fast synced nodes.

(I believe the BCH dev team is looking into UTXO commitment, actually.. if they brought some boost in nodes that would nothing short of amazing!)

&gt;&amp;gt; Bitcoin node broadcasts they don‚Äôt have to find a route

&gt;LN nodes broadcast their presence. there is no routing required to keep the graph connected.

The topology is dynamic, nodes need to broadcast their status (not only presence but liquidity, etc..) each time a transaction is made.

&gt;&amp;gt; And It seems LN current mainnet topology is already show hubs forming.

&gt;as long as hubs are independent and don't hinder other nodes becoming a hub - the system is safely decentralized.

Certainly, time will tell if they can stay independent.

&gt;&amp;gt; Overblown maybe but that a fundamental limitation

&gt;that's the definition of FUD right there.

FUD suggests I lied about the limitations.. I linked two projects that have re-written their code because of that limitations.

To me it is not FUD but simply a use case that don‚Äôt fit with LN.

&gt;&amp;gt; no guarantee to protect decentralisation (like ETH show)

&gt;ETH shows *exactly* how a system is continuously pushed into centralization due to cost of running a node.

Can you elaborate, all the data I know suggests the opposite.

&gt;&amp;gt; unsustainable long term

&gt;unsustainable what? the moment fees go over what's economical users choose to transact less or more efficiently which brings fees back down.

On block rewards is gone fees will need to remain beyond $20-80 to sustainable a reasonable amount of POW.

&gt;&amp;gt; undeniable that BTC small block philosophy is to only use the main chain to access sidechain or second layer over the long term. It will be simply uneconomical to use the main chain for anything else

&gt;quite deniable. where is your evidence that is will always be uneconomical to use mainnet for anything other than sidechains and payment channels?

Fee need to remain very very high to support the network PoW.

This is not compatible with P2Pecash.. it is either one or the other. BTC dev have chosen high fees second layer.

Design choice I guess, but arguing onchain tx will be still useful with fees in the $30-$80.. is well strange to me, to say the least.

&gt;&amp;gt; core dev have said they look forward to $100/$1000 fees

&gt; 
&gt; The FUD starts to ring true and everything you see is bad news and lower lows. Several paydays have gone by and you thought you had bought the dip but you continue to be proven wrong.  
&gt; 
&gt; You think the end is coming. Bitcoin is dead. 
&gt; 
&gt; But then a miracle happens, you come across the white paper again and catch a glimpse of the continual development that‚Äôs taking place. You see a small bit of news where we are breaking new ground while all the superficial talk was on bear markets and tulips. You see hash rate jump and wonder what brought it on. You see the lightening network has grown to several thousand nodes when the last time you saw it it was under 100. You then think that actually it‚Äôs not all that bad. 
&gt; 
&gt; By this time you have grown stronger and wiser. You know more about the tech than ever before and know how it will change the world. You add a little more to your stash. It feels exciting again like you have rediscovered it for the first time. Others begin to feel the same. An uptick occurs, you buy a little more. Your DCA is as low as ever and every little increase has a multiplier effect. 
&gt; 
&gt; You have now developed level 1 strong hands. Your next level is earned with the next cycle, then the next. You think back and you see that we are witnessing a paradigm shift and all the price talk was just a distraction. This journey is what counts and in 20 years you will have a great story to tell.

I will say this, if the banks start going this route, This will push people into this world faster than you can ever realize. People hate banks and this will give them a better reason to ditch them.

Then there's scarcity, the fact that there's a finite amount of each, that it's difficult to acquire and also there's all of the time, effort and energy (electricity) that is consumed to mine it which gives it value.

buyinglow,"Crypto noob here just in since late December. I've recently started trading in ETH pairs and  decided today that I'm hodling eth (instead of btc like I was doing) when I'm sleeping, feel like the market might tank or just want to not think about things.

My portfolio is a mix of some newly tradable coins that I've picked up for 2-4x ICO price in the past few days and some small - mid cap coins.

I'm worried a large correction is still playing out since the ATH in December and I wonder if there is a significant drop (e.g. btc falls below 8k even) would the smaller and newer coins fall less hard?

What do people think? I also have a hunch the writing may be on the wall for bitcoin. The MSM seems to be fearmongering hard about btc- much harder than they are about crypto in general and I reckon this might prove to be significant in coming days or weeks.

Kimchido,"""The whole market went through a stabilization."" 
Don't freak out. Its very similar to last year and year before. Christmas to Start of Q1 has been bit bloody around this time of the year. Especially this year, Thanks to Korea, China and India. However, I see it as a normal thing because correction is always healthy for the market. Every countries *do* need to something about regulating crypto since its becoming too popular everywhere. I see it as a natural move for any governments and countries. Smart pants are investing more now, so they can invest less later. Turning it into a huge profit and that's the way they did it in the past. How the hack did people get rich off of a bitcoin when it was only few cents? They went in while it was cheap. I only wish I had more money to invest more right now. 

:(
... and that's perfectly normal. Its like nature natural.
Its just the way it is. I just want to quote, its not all about the main-net. State of total market capitalization should be in state of mind also.

Kastelukannu,"Thanks for your comment. Do you happen to have first hand experience with these local exchanges or with remittance in general?

I read in a book (this is why I got the idea) that using bitcoin was/is cheaper than Western Union, etc in remittance. But of course I'm not sure if this (still) is the case or true at all. Of course exchanges want to make some money, too. However, maybe (technological) development leads to new exchanges with lower fees or existing ones changing their fee structure for crypto so that it makes sense to use crypto (preferably NAV) for remittance. Also maybe NAV is coming up with some tech that could make it easier to adopt it in the remittance sector as you said. You are definitely right that there needs to be some incentive for the exchanges, too. I could imagine that due to technological advances there might come exchanges that can use crypto in remittance and can have lower fees thus challenging the existing exchanges. Something that requires less manpower and is easy to handle could make it. The atm idea expressed in another comment is one option, though legal aspects need to be considered. Regarding that latter, upcoming regulation might be actually good. When the rules for crypto are set (preferably on a global scale), it might actually be easier to build up for example an atm network somewhere. Assuming that the regulation is a useful regulation and not some sort of ban.

I generally think that the whole remittance sector might a real good opportunity for NAV as there also seems less competition with other crypto (maybe?) and the general idea of NAV (easy to use, fast, cheap) is perfect for this multi billion Dollar market. At least this is what I currently think.

I also forgot to mention that volatility is something that might scare migrants from using crpyto/NAV in remittance, but on the other hand it also makes people less interested in using to buy stuff.",dtiex3y,2,1/31/2018 2:54,,,,,,

&gt; Bitcoin has the largest proof of work chain (by work). It has the largest network hash power, making it the most secure. It‚Äôs the most common trade partner. It‚Äôs still near the highest in number of transactions (ripple and ether slightly outpace it, ether I believe is due to dapps and ico‚Äôs so legit, but ripple I think is a bit of a fad that won‚Äôt last). As far as fees, they‚Äôre way down right now, and will only be lower/faster with lightning network. It also has the largest and best development team.

blocksofchain,"Interesting dilemma. Tether needs to back the tokens 1 to 1 in the bank (wether they do or not is another discussion). If there is another $30m USDT hack, then they would also have to back that. There have also been reports of people/companies held at gunpoint and forced to transfer bitcoin. Being able to blacklist and redeem these ""evilUser"" would be a defence for that. I see that in case of that kind of disaster this would be a good tool for Tether, not so much for the people that stole the money or the poor people that unknowingly took the stolen money.

If someone hacked and got control over the smart contract, then they could also just as well print endless amount of tokens, forcing Tether to deploy new contracts with a different state (basically the same as blacklisting and redeeming). So from that point I think this feature would just make it easier to maintain a correct balance and state. 

Unlike bitcoin, Tether is 1 to 1 to USD. The token is worthless if no one is going to redeem it.

IMHO I think the biggest risk about government coercion is the fact that Tether is not regulated. Owners of the token have no way of knowing if they are backing what they issue. So the risk is not if the government is going to force Tether to blacklist someone, it is that the government will shutdown Tether.",dtieorl,2,1/31/2018 2:44,,,,,,

Remember that difficulty is balance of supply and demand just as price is.

If you are converting cash to BTC...

Start with $100. Mine $50 of BTC and pay $50 in USD over 1 month.

In 1 month price of BTC goes from $1 USD to $2 USD.

Now you have $50 USD and $100 BTC. (to illustrate)

So it depends on where you think the price will land in the future, and if you have the means to convert electricity to bitcoin and maintain that accumulation until prices return to favorable rates.

The depends on prices returning to favorable rates at all.

I'll say it again: it's very probable that they printed tethers to make crypto withdrawals possible. In the bull market there is a serious redistribution of currency, and they should grant:
1. Very fast withdrawals. For instance, you deposit 1 Bitcoin. Somebody deposits $10k cash. He buys your Bitcoin, but then something happens in your life and you need to withdraw 0.5 of your deposit. How it can be possible, if the crypto exchange had no reserves? And they can replenish those with USDTs, because most ex—Åhanges have no rights to trade USD for crypto directly.
2. Flash crash protection. User ""bitfinexed"" already mentioned ""spoofy"" with a very big position. It is protection from instant falls, which does not work in natural market conditions.

""As long as the cryptocurrency is worth more than $6,925, miners will still make money, according to Sophie Lu, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF)""

Pretul astazi este de $10148. Uite si o evolutie in timp:

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/

Conform graficului sunt patru scenarii. Dureaza inca sase luni sa ajunga la un pret care nu mai este rentabil pentru mineri, se prabuseste subit si ramane acolo, creste si mai mult, sau ramane la fel. 

Din punt de vedere economic, o urcare si crestere asemanatoare sunt cele mai probabile, prin urmare este posibil sa vedem o scadere in urmatoarele sase luni si nu mai devreme. Binenteles, este o piata volatila si se pot intampla multe. 

Este insa mult mai probabil ca Nvidia si AMD sa mareasca considerabil productia de cipuri. Si este foarte probabil sa avem niste preturi foarte mici la placi grafice pentru urmatoarea generatie sau cea din 2019. AMD si Nvidia vor face foarte multe cipuri sa compenseze pentru cerere, insa mineritul va deveni neprofitabil. Piata ar putea fi inundata cu mult mai multe placi decat se vor cumpara.

In concluzie, nu iti face sperante pentru urmatoarele 6 luni. Asta ar fi cel mai probabil scenariu.

EDIT: Am uitat sa scriu ca cele 6 luni includ si problema capacitatii de productie a fabricilor AMD si Nvidia. Chiar daca s-ar prabusi astazi Bitcoin, tot ar dura cateva luni ca preturile sa revina la normal, la placi noi.

The next $200M is critical. Also, this is good for Bitcoin.

Seriously though, people are equating a subpoena with Tether being insolvent when there's a lot of less dire scenarios it could represent. They've continued operating and issuing more tether bolstering the notion that nothing's *seriously* wrong. 

Exchanges make enough in fees that it could easily be backed. You could read the high issuance of tethers as the market composed of major exchanges that are all holding that tether and individually responsible for customer's fiat withdrawals all collectively agreeing to take on that counterparty risk. 

Now there's a bit of a run on the bank and I don't hear *anyone* having trouble withdrawing, coins or fiat. Anyone?

Running as a hatchet, you ""join the bets"" with 0 risk, you've got nothing to loose and this should change in my opinion.

A simple solution would be to make items available for safe container only after successful extraction (item could get a flag on extraction) - so for example, you find factory key in raid, you can only put it into your pockets/backpack/vest while in the same raid, once you extract you can join another raid with this key in you safe container.

wordonewordtwo,"Since this isn't just about the price of GNT but also about its role in the whole of Golem tech, I think this belongs in this sub.

&gt; GNT is not company shares

Buying Bitcoin doesn't give you a stake in the Blockstream company, too. This is besides the point. As /u/jet86 said - supply and demand, it's that simple. The more people actually use Golem, the more demand for GNT there will be. If they hold the GNT for one minute before spending or make a stash and hold it for a month - the demand increases in both cases. Also there is the concept of a ""deposit based antiSybil"" that is to be implemented in Brass beta, where a deposit of GNT will be held for some duration to secure against fraud. So a certain amount of GNT will be bound through this mechanism alone.


And yes, I think hodling **does** support the project, since the team is holding significant amounts of GNT. Lowering the supply of GNT by hodling through wind and weather helps increasing the price. Plus, although no techie will want to hear this, sadly the single most important thing that makes any project pop up on the radar of the broader public (and I don't mean traders) is the price. It signals success and that's what catches attention. So hodling is inherently good indeed :)",dtidi5t,2,1/31/2018 1:58,,,,,,

Nothing, you make enormous profits from the sell off and the short sale, its totally legal and fuck everyone else. I think that is why you are seeing the volatility since this started.

The FUD starts to ring true and everything you see is bad news and lower lows. Several paydays have gone by and you thought you had bought the dip but you continue to be proven wrong.  

You think the end is coming. Bitcoin is dead. 

But then a miracle happens, you come across the white paper again and catch a glimpse of the continual development that‚Äôs taking place. You see a small bit of news where we are breaking new ground while all the superficial talk was on bear markets and tulips. You see hash rate jump and wonder what brought it on. You see the lightening network has grown to several thousand nodes when the last time you saw it it was under 100. You then think that actually it‚Äôs not all that bad. 

By this time you have grown stronger and wiser. You know more about the tech than ever before and know how it will change the world. You add a little more to your stash. It feels exciting again like you have rediscovered it for the first time. Others begin to feel the same. An uptick occurs, you buy a little more. Your DCA is as low as ever and every little increase has a multiplier effect. 

You have now developed level 1 strong hands. Your next level is earned with the next cycle, then the next. You think back and you see that we are witnessing a paradigm shift and all the price talk was just a distraction. This journey is what counts and in 20 years you will have a great story to tell.

I am sure the (Bitcoin)0riginalName was the original ""agreed name"" and original Blockchain ""Spec-witepaper-Chain0riginal"" that everyone agreed to build upon together to distribute and would follow the the agreed spec in the Bitcoin Whitepaper which is 

(a)""largest-chain"" with ""largest hashing power"" with the ""Most-users, nodes, devs"".. so basically because its decentralized the majority agreed to the new updated""spec-witePaper-Chain0riginalv2"" the ""largest chain"" system kept the original name just updated the Block Chain code to version2.
and
(b)If someone wants to do their own thing in that they can fork, but the fork wont be the main ""Chain0riginal"" unless the majority Votes as agreed by part (a) above to follow the main chain. 

BitcoinName0riginal/Chain0riginal 
or 
Bitcoin/Chain0riginal 
Example:
The original name Bitcoin-BTC/and original version 1 of the blockchain has say 506930 blocks and majority of the hash power.

If someone wants to do their own thing and forks the bitcoin blockchain and calls it: BitcoinName1more=Chain1more..
Have a nice day no discussion needed because they are in their own world by themselves, they can call their chain what they want because they don't have the hashing power to overtake the 506930 block majority. They hash slower blocks per sec and would need to have the larger hash power and more than 506930 blocks to be as secure as the main BitcoinName0riginal/BlockchainOriginal v3.

If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.

""But banks do not need to use Ripple tokens for Ripple‚Äôs software to transfer dollars, euros and yen. That point appears to be lost on many small time investors who are buying Ripple tokens.""

i_adore_you,"As the ""condensed version"" of the link you've been given:

1. PoW - You, the miner, have hashing power based on how quickly your computer can process and cycle through numbers until it finds a combination that, when hashed, will be less than some target value. Once you find that, you get to generate the next block.

2. PoS - You, the staker, have hashing power based on the coin groups you own. Every coin group has unique properties (such as the timestamp they were created, the hash of the transaction they were created in, the time of the block that transaction was in, and more) which are run through the same hashing function as in PoW, and if those values all put together are less than the target value, you get to generate the next block.

The only difference is that all of the guesswork is taken out of the equation. There is no amount of processing power you can throw at the problem to make it easier or faster, because all of your inputs to the hashing function are already known to the network, at large, and are out of your control. In NAV, the timestamp of the block you would like to create is also one of those inputs, and this is what ensures that you will eventually hit below the target value. This also means that you only have one try every second to beat the target value, which is a processing requirement that pretty much any computer (or even a Raspberry Pi) can keep up with.

Every other aspect of the network security operation is identical (and I do mean identical, NAV is built on Bitcoin core). You need to have a full node online to be checking your groups of coins to see if one can win, and that node is also validating blocks from adjacent nodes while it's doing so, thus providing the standard distributed consensus of the blockchain.",dticnpb,2,1/31/2018 1:27,,,,,,

On the whole mining has been (way) more upwards than its been downwards in the last year. The current downtrend isn't likely to affect used markets too much unless BTC devaluates a lot further still (eg down to 5K -- unlikely)

Base58 library is so commonly, generically used... doesn't seem like a good attack, but 1) base58 can easily be tested that it's not spitting out hardcoded results, and 2) this code (or any key generation) should ever be run on a PC that will ever touch a network... if one smart and paranoid.

You got me thinking(paranoid) actually... that best attack on this script would be hardcoded results from os.urandom ... A good addition to this script would be loop on.urandom for 10 minutes checking for duplicates, to verify its not compromised.

Illtakecash,"I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say large institutions. Like banks? Because, banks advertise, heavily. Like telecom companies? Because there are only a handful in the states (for example) that control the market, and they advertise. Like Schools/ Universities? They do a lot of advertising. Like Churches? They advertise, rather intrusively at times. Like Governments? Yup you probably guessed it. Literally everyone advertises. How in the world are you supposed to build a reputation if no one knows you exist? 

The definition for a security is provided below and is different from what you are defining as a security. 

A security is a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation (via stock), a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation (represented by owning that entity's bond), or rights to ownership as represented by an option.

Read more: Security https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp#ixzz55k0i1yZv

Your definition of security is lacking the fundamental idea of ownership in the entity. By definition a decentralized application cannot qualify as a security, a publicly traded token can however, and a large number of currencies are technically companies. As soon as there is 51%  ownership by one entity, or organization, in a ""decentralized"" application it is no longer decentralized. Securities do not have anything to do with turning profits at their most basic level. If bitcoin for example did not turn a profit for its nodes it would not be in existence, so your argument is fundamentally invalid. Even Satoshi had to advertise bitcoin in one way or another in order for it to catch on the way that it did, and publishing a white paper is a completely viable, and free, advertisement.

xxDan_Evansxx,"That is a very good question.  No, it's not just based on popularity.

The genesis of bitcoin is really unique because of the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto.  Cryptocurrency was basically just a science experiment for a few years.  There was some really truly organic growth for years without any obvious effort from the founders to get rich on the project.

It will be nearly impossible to duplicate a similar genesis story with a new project.  All projects naturally start as centralized.  Even Bitcoin was just a few people at first.  The fact that Satoshi Nakamoto has over $10 Billion in bitcoin that he never moved means he is likely dead, or perhaps the group that is Satoshi made those coins intentionally unretrievable forever for the good of the project.

The idea behind bitcoin was to create money that could be moved peer to peer that no government or large organization (banks, etc.) could stop.  If a project has a handful of people that could be jailed which would effectively stop the project or destroy its value, it doesn't meet that objective.  I really think Bitcoin is the only project that passes that test right now.

The arduous process to implement the SegWit upgrade really demonstrates how difficult it is to make protocol level changes with bitcoin.  It is very easy to make major changes on more centralized projects.  The difficulty to change things is actually a feature and not a bug with respect to what we are talking about.

It is not impossible that another project could become as decentralized as bitcoin, but it is very unlikely.  I don't think it would happen simply because of lower fees or faster transaction propagation.  If you think about it, those things can almost always be improved by whatever coin is the newest, but it makes no sense that the newest coins would be the best for long term value storage.  You need one long term stateless ledger to price things.  Analog, that is gold, with little real competition for thousands of years despite other metals with more rarity, etc.  Time itself makes it stronger in it's role.  First is a really big advantage for this specific application.",dtibcls,2,1/31/2018 0:44,,,,,,

The equipment is all manufactured there, including the individual components, the companies that make the ASICs mine with them before selling them to consumers, and now we only have a handful of companies to go to if we want to mine Bitcoin.",dtib9qa,2,1/31/2018 0:41,,,,,,
vulvasniffer,"Hi bro. sorry that you have to experience this terrible thing. i was gonna ask how you got keylogged but seems like you're also at a loss on this part. i'm really sorry.


But i also have questions about the case. Please anyone can chime in.


1. Why is it possible to send Ada to a non-existing address? i remember i was once accidentally entering my bitcoin address incorrectly into a wallet but it's not accepting the address and it's saying that it's not a valid address, i thought that was neat.


2. If the address doesn't exist, how the shit can it get confirmations? It has at least 170 confirmations at the time of posting. It's like reporting that a package has been delivered in this address and that 170 people or more can confirm it was delivered. but the fucking address doesn't exist at all. wtf?

PissedOfMiner,"First let me issue a disclaimer.  **This is not directed at any specific company or exchange and is intended for educational purposes only.  This is not legal advice and as such I cannot be held liable accordingly.  Always consult with a licensed attorney or legal representative concerning your local laws regarding what may or may not be applicable in your jurisdiction.**

&amp;nbsp;

The U.S. regulatory agency, S.E.C., regularly works with foreign countries governments and regulatory agencies when enforcing laws on foreign companies.  There is more than ample case law and literature that will verify this.  That does not apply to all, or even most U.S. or other countries laws.  Most laws do not give jurisdiction to one country over another.  We will use the example of KimDotCom.

&amp;nbsp;

As a New Zealand citizen, the U.S.'s Department of Justice does not have the jurisdiction to send their agents to New Zealand to arrest him.  They must legally have New Zealand extradite him.  This is obvious, or should be to most people.  Which is exactly why he is still in New Zealand and not in the U.S. either in court or jail.  He has been able to fight extradition for the last 6 years, and hopefully that's how it stays.  However, there are certain things which does fall under the jurisdiction of foreign countries.  I'm not even going to try to list them here as that isn't important.

&amp;nbsp;

The most important thing however is how the U.S. extends it's jurisdiction when they should have absolutely no legal grounds. Specifically this falls under the Dodd-Frank Act.  **""Under the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. courts have jurisdiction over claims of securities violations brought by the SEC or DOJ that involve:**
**1)** **Significant steps in furtherance of a violation that occurred in the United States even if the transaction took place outside the United States; or**
**2)** **Conduct outside the United States that has a ‚Äúforeseeable substantial effect‚Ä?within the United [States.""](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2011/08/05/the-dodd-frank-extraterritorial-jurisdiction-provision)**

&amp;nbsp;

Currently the U.S. has on more than occasion claimed jurisdiction over a foreign cryptocurrency exchange.  Once for a civil claim against **/*Mt. Gox*/(Japan)** from 2014, in U.S. Federal court.  I haven't fully looked in to all the details of this particular case in the State of Illinois.  More details can be found [here.](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-ilnd-1_14-cv-01437/pdf/USCOURTS-ilnd-1_14-cv-01437-0.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

This was used more specifically last year when the U.S. SEC and DOJ sought charges against BTC-e, a Russian Exchange, and it's owner Alexander Vinnik.  Accordingly BTC-e's assests including domain, etc. was seized by the U.S. and charged with operating an unlicensed money service business, money laundering, and related crimes.  Details of this case can be found [here.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/russian-national-and-bitcoin-exchange-charged-21-count-indictment-operating-alleged)

&amp;nbsp;

To make sure that I'm not wrong and offer evidence showing that it is being taken that seriously, all you have to do is look at *Tether* and *Bitfinex*.  NOTE: all information regarding the following companies is not my opinion but are the facts that have been released in accordance with the leaked Paradise Papers and other information.  Whatever the financial status of any and all parties involved does not imply any guilt and should not be taken as such.  For the purpose of this article, it is used only as an educational tool.

&amp;nbsp;

Most exchanges pair the *USDT* and not **USD**.  This is done so foreign exchanges don't have to worry about reporting and banking laws that any company dealing with **USD** is legally obligated to do but they are still able to pair things against the US dollar which we all see it listed as **USDT/BTC**.  A vast majority of people will never notice nor even give this a second thought.  Exchanges do this specifically because using the **USD** would subject them to U.S. banking laws but since Tether *""USDT""* is a coin and not money, exchanges don't have to follow U.S. banking laws. This creates an extra layer of protection for exchanges and they are able to operate much easier without accidentally breaking those or other U.S. money-laundering, know your customer, etc. laws.

&amp;nbsp;

Many in the community remember last year when *Bitfinex* announced they announced they were stopping all user activity for U.S. citizen  accounts.  This was done for a very specific reason, and if you research what Bitfinex did after the last hack of $70 million **USD**, you will understand why.  I'm sure a lot of people that weren't around when the hack occurred wouldn't believe what the exchange did to their customers.  Long story short, *Tether* lost U.S. banking relations which caused people to question what was really going on.  That's why we have the information we do now.  

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway back to subject on hand.  Including using the aforementioned way that exchanges protect themselves by pairing with USDT and not **USD**; *Tether* further protects itself by separating itself into multiple entities; *Tether Limited (‚ÄúTLTD‚Ä?* for U.S. citizens, *Tether International Limited (‚ÄúTIL‚Ä?* for all Non U.S. citizens for the purpose of issuing, use, etc. of the *Tether coin*.  *Tether ""TIL""*, *Tether ""TLTD""* and *Bitfinex* (owned by *iFinex Inc.*) are incorporated in Hong Kong.  Last but not least, and most important. *""Tether Holdings""* founded in 2014, and *iFinex Inc*. are both based in British Virgin Islands.  These are the only parts of *Tether* and *Bitfinex* that receive real money, actual US dollars, Euro's, Yen, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Any exchange, wallet, etc. that accepts actual money payments dealing with cryptocurrency knows that by accepting real money they must follow [AML/CTF](https://www.state.gov/j/inl/c/crime/c44634.htm) laws of whichever jurisdiction that would apply.  Hence why most all exchanges pair with USDT and not USD.  Furthermore, most people are also aware that the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, etc. are considered tax havens and the U.S. can't do a damn thing.  No government can.  There is much more about Tether if anyone wants to look further, it should be easy for anyone following along to see the possible implications.  For our purpose, all we need is know how the companies are structured.  

&amp;nbsp;

Now this part is not asking anyone to make any loose connections, or even try to connect all the dots together.  We are going to look at this from a dumbed down point of view.  If you didn't know what company it was that  was structured in the exact same way with multiple sister corps, parent corps, locations, etc. most people would be baffled as to why any company would go through all that trouble.  What practical reason could a cryptocurrency company, in a unregulated world, have to do that in the first place?",dtib8l9,2,1/31/2018 0:40,,,,,,

Also note the complete lack of any utility or function for the AusCoin token. And, the CLASSIC red flag for any crypto: when he asserts the value will go up when it hits exchanges and people start trading it. That's NOT where value should come from. His focus is on price (red flag), but he can't even MAKE UP a reason why this token will be of any benefit to anybody.

Then that SUPER CRINGE on the ""basically unofficially teamed up with Bitcoin"". Wow. I think he hoped that buzz word would slip past the reporter and go straight to the suckers watching at home. Unlucky Sam. Watching him flounder and provide no explanation for that comment was cringe as fuck.

Bitcoin is a supply and demand asset and it does not hold a value capacity like a stock. It doesn‚Äôt matter even if people have bought BTC with USDT and that increased its price. If the demand for BTC is there, then it‚Äôs price will remain.

The only way the global market crashes is through their own FUD as they fear tether will crash the market, so they don‚Äôt invest, which ironically actually crashes the market.

The only people that are at risk are people who own tether. If there‚Äôs a report that states tether is not backed 1-1 then it‚Äôll crash and drop to 0 and anyone who owns tether will be royally fucked.

The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco asks the question, but never really answers it: https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2005/june/prime-interest-rate/.

Here are the types of organizations that can apply:

Interestingly, international organizations can get those cheap funds. (Note that in this list that Financial Holding Companies are also foreign).

Then there is a very special relationship between the Fed and the Treasury: https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/ESF/Pages/reserve.aspx.

Beyond that, you can dive deeper.

This seems to be a good description, though I do not know how accurate it is:

ReginaldWatson,"While Global Poker might be the *only* answer to OP's question, tread lightly. Global Poker is a disaster waiting to happen (in my opinion).

I'll eat my own words if I'm wrong, but I'm willing to bet that this honeymoon Global Poker is on right now will come crashing to a halt sooner rather than later.

A handful of sites have used the same sweepstakes method as Global Poker in the past, and all have faded away. This site does not do a single thing to differentiate itself from it's predecessors.

PayPal **does not** allow gambling transactions, plain and simple. 

I'm not saying Global Poker is a scam, but I do believe it will be shut down/stop offering real-money poker soon.

My advice would be to learn about Bitcoin, and use that to deposit onto one of the larger USA-friendly online gambling sites. ",dtiavh7,2,1/31/2018 0:29,,,,,,

PoliticalDissidents,"&gt; Can they (Finex or US gov) LEGALLY just take billions of customer's money?

They did it to BTC-e. 

I don't think that will happen here considering that BTC-e was laundering money which made it easy to convince local authorities to go after BTC-e. The CFTC's job however doesn't have to do with laundering money it has to do with commodities trading notably in this context regulating futures trading. Good luck seeing the US convince foreign law enforcement to start enforcing laws that don't apply there pertaining to the Commodity Exchange Act.

An other reason it's unlikely anything happens is because they were subpoena 55 days ago and nothing happened since. If they were going to shut them down why wait so long?

If you are concerned just mitigate risk, withdraw some funds and leave the rest there.

ScatteredCastles,"I'll give you an analysis. Look at this annotated chart (and note that I made it three days ago):  
https://imgur.com/a/nimxs

Three days ago, I wrote elsewhere:  I think it's going to take big hit soon.

One way of analyzing prices is with something called Technical Analysis. It's a bit of voodoo witchcraft. Basically, there are common cycles, patterns, waves, etc., sometimes they predict the future and sometimes not. Some commodities are more predictable than others using these techniques. I've seen in the past that Bitcoin tends to be somewhat predictable. One theory is that Technical Analysis doesn't work, but if enough people BELIEVE it works, then, bizarrely, it does work. If enough people believe in one fate, they collectively can make it happen.

Anyway, a classic pattern in Technical Analysis is the descending pennant. See the two black lines I've drawn. The top line is the resistance. It's the highest price buyers are willing to pay. The bottom line is the support. It's the lowest price at which sellers are willing to sell.

The buyers and sellers are in a war. When the two lines converge, and the price isn't moving much at all, look out. It's due for a sudden break-out. And with descending pennants, it breaks downwards.

capn_hector,"The prices of cryptos (and mining profits) tend to move together on big market movements (+/- some degree of individual variation of course).

For example, daily profit on a 1080 started at $5-ish, peaked at $7-8 a month ago, to $5 a day over the last couple weeks, down to like $3.50 a day over the last couple days.  Vega started at $6-7/day, spiked up to &gt;$12/day, and is now down to ~$4.50 a day.  You can't just ""mine something else"" because everything is down together.  In particular, altcoins don't have independent value in USD, they tend to move against the ""reserve currency"", i.e. bitcoin.  Bitcoin goes up, altcoins go up.  Bitcoin goes down, altcoins go down.

Will there always be something to mine?  Sure.  Will it be 100-day ROIs on a card?  Not necessarily, in fact it's perfectly possible the margin collapses down to zero profit as difficulty continues to increase, or even negative (meaning people with cheaper electricity than you dominate the network - a lot of Chinese farms get free electricity through deals with corrupt local officials).  There is no *guarantee* of free money just for leaving your computer on.

On the other hand it's quite likely to be cyclical - there was a boom last spring from Ethereum, then profits cooled back down over the summer/fall as difficulty increased.  Then there was a boom in Bitcoin prices that benefited altcoins around October/November, and now difficulty is increasing back and profits are cooling back down again.  My opinion is that's the pattern we're likely to see from now on - which is unfortunate for gamers, since this boom/bust pattern makes it very difficult to manage GPU supply.

And in the short term, unless there is another major boom in the price of BTC (unlikely given that Tether's printing press is now under regulatory scrutiny), profits are going nowhere except down at the moment (including altcoins) and you may not hit ROI within this boom/bust cycle.  If you can still sell your hardware at inflated prices, it's not a bad time to do so,

In this sense, it's actually a shitty time for AMD to be ramping production.  We needed that 4-6 months ago, it's too late now, and this is the point in time where AMD is actually risking a flood of used cards driving down prices, as well as competition against a new generation of NVIDIA cards releasing within a few months.",dtiansj,2,1/31/2018 0:23,,,,,,

* On the other hand, Bitcoin **cannot** be shut down.

* IOW, Tether loses its status as ""reserve"" for traders once it's shut down, which can only possibly benefit Bitcoin.

CanadianCryptoGuy,"Right.  I meant do you call it the largest by asset holdings, by daily volumes, by profitability, or by a different metric?  It looks like you're considering daily volumes.

Remember that this link that you provided only includes all BTC trades.  A competing exchange with heavy alt trading might have more overall daily dollar volume than one with lighter alt trading.

Also, are you adding up all the different exchange pairs on that chart?  Bitfinex may have the single largest trading pair for one single pair (Bitcoin to Tether), but you should add up all the different lines for each exchange.  For example, OKEx has five separate dollar amounts in the top twenty lines on that chart (at the time of writing this) whereas Bitfinex has only the top position.  If you add up those five OKEx lines, they total much more than the single Bitfinex dollar amount.

I think the best metric would be volume based, but should be something like, ""Total 24hr volume of all trades combined, per exchange.""  I'm not sure where to find that specific data online.

Right now the fees on Bitcoin have hit some serious lows due to transaction volume falling like a rock - now is absolutely *the* time for them to send back as many Omni Tethers as possible to be replaced with Ethereum Tethers.",dtiafds,2,1/31/2018 0:16,,,,,,

You may be joking, but the entire post was in response to a question about the difference in the tech between various cryptos.  If you bought at a recent price high, I hate that for you, but it has nothing to do with what we were discussing or the long term value proposition offered by bitcoin, and by no other crypto.

As far as short term speculation, almost all crypto can be fantastic for that.  Even downward price movements in bitcoin can be profitable if you trade them effectively.  That has nothing to do with the question I was responding to though.",dtiadek,2,1/31/2018 0:14,,,,,,
WillDoDatDevDoe,"&gt; But now you can buy a shit ton of graphics cards and actually make money mining alt coins. I've always relied on a personal truism that if subsidized miners are making money, crypto is in a bubble, and it has mostly held true. Subsidized in this context mean free hardware, free electricity, or selling 'shares' of their rig for money.

Except very few people have actually done this yet as most people who are trying it currently bought in when the price of cards already went up.  That was rather recent and I doubt they's made their money back yet, much less a profit.  At the end of this people could make a good amount of money and end up looking very smart or the coins they are mining could implode and the graphics cards they bought at a markup could fall back to retail prices in a sellers market and they end up looking fairly stupid.  A little too early to call it either way and I'd say anyone who claims these people are geniuses or idiots needs to cool their jets and wait to see how this all plays out.  Personally I'm 35 and talking to people about cryptocurrency right now feels eerily similar to the way people were talking about real estate in 2007.  Lots of ""I wish I had bought before the jump"" and people who are late to the game trying to get in and driving the prices up even more.  The lesson I learned from that is to be careful when people are investing in things where a good % of the price is clearly driven by speculation.  Also a lesson from the stock market in 2008, you aren't rich until you cash out.

If you price American goods in yen, you'll find the prices jump around considerably too, because you're pricing out of the loop.

They'd go back up again, and people would have access to their money. This happened many times. 

Even after taking my money out of bit grail, I would read people freaking out about more withdrawal issues. I'd think ""eh, it'll be fine... like last time""

Bitgrail then decided to disable withdrawals for US customers, and everybody needs to send in ID verification to be able to withdraw anything. This effectively locked up a bunch of money at the exchange. People in the US will not be able to withdraw Rai ever. They will have to sell into bitcoin and withdraw the bitcoin.

Before crypto I was a successful person but it would have still taken me maybe three years of after tax income to make the money that I'm now seeing myself lose in a single day. I take it in stride because I've been there when Bitcoin tanked 80% and I still believe it'll recover strongly in the future, but it still stings to see that potential lost.

I mean basically you're seeing what could have been a very nice early retirement evaporate in front of your eyes, which is going to stress anybody out. My net worth went up a ton last year but it's down about 45% from the peak. Very much a first world problem because I'm still much better off than I ever was before, but seeing what could be a nice early retirement evaporate still sucks an awful lot. Keep in mind you need to be able to live off of about 4% of what you have after paying your taxes in order to retire, and if you bought into a lot of positions less than a year ago you're looking at almost 50% in taxes (or higher in some states) if you sell millions of dollars worth all at once.

Franks2000inchTV,"Yeah, but for Tether the idea is that 1 USTD = 1 USD, because they say they have 1 USD for every 1 USDT.

If they sell USTD for bitcoin, and then bitcoin falls below the price they paid, then they have less value (in USD) then they have on outstanding USDT.

Thus USDT is worth less than 1 USD, and so every transaction between USDT and every other currency (crypto or fiat) has been transacted at a lower value than as reported.

(If I buy $10 worth of bitcoin for 10 USDT, and it turns out that USDT is only actually worth $0.90 then the person who sold me the bitcoin only got $9 (of value) and not $10.

So then the price of all crypto currencies is artificially supported by this lie that 1 USDT = 1 USD and the actual value of bitcoin and all other currencies is lower than it‚Äôs currently reported by the difference between the *actual* value of USDT and the real value which could be 20%-30% lower (at best) 


Edit: also, not every coin was bought with fiat (at least not with the value of the coin now) for instance if I bought a bitcoin for $100 a few year ago, and I only now sell it, then 99% of the value of that coin is not supported by fiat currency.

DoctimusLime,"Can't Ripple do everything that bitcoin can, but realistically (in regards to realistic transaction speed, costs, and scalability)?

Also, I get that Ethereum has smart contracts, but apart from that it's nowhere near as fast, cheap, or scalable as Ripple. And Ripple already has real world partnerships with real companies using their xCurrent and xRapid platforms.

Seems to me like Ripple is going to be integrated into our current financial systems whether we like it or not, and frankly, the technology behind Ethereum and Bitcoin isn't really... realistic. They just don't have the scalability to replace fiat currency, which leads me to the conclusion that Ripple will be the bridge between fiat and crypto. Also, stellar is kind of cute, but it doesn't have the relationships that are being made RIGHT NOW.

Seems to me like Ripple did it all better while looking to realistically work with our current systems as opposed to some childish notion of overthrowing them. That and they already have real partners genuinely using their platforms, which will lead to XRP becoming the #1 digital asset until something comes along and does it cheaper and faster...

At the very least we know that when they said they had ~400 million in USD they had about the same amount of tethers and friedman had verified that. Now since then they've created a ton of Tethers but it was also in a very hot market where tons of people were trying to buy into Bitcoin, so it's at least somewhat plausible that there was real demand for Tethers. $2.5 billion is not that much when you consider how many hedge funds were trying to get into Bitcoin.

Could the whole thing be a huge scam? Sure, but I actually find it less likely than that it's just a very sketchy end run around a lack of banking.

""The fundamental assumption behind this test is wrong. Tether is issued mainly when the effective tether price at usdt exchanges becomes significantly higher than $1, for arbitrage. This happens mostly when btc corrects and everyone escapes into tether.

So obviously tether issuance *is* correlated with bitcoin's price, duh. Tether issuance for arbitrage is an 'organic business process'.

&gt; also that Tether injection at Bitfinex creates a significant rise in the price of Bitcoin.

What a perfect example of mistaking correlation with causation. How come bitfinex's prices were usually lower than gdax? I have no statistical analysis but I remember that for most of the time bitfinex was lower."" - /u/nootropicat
